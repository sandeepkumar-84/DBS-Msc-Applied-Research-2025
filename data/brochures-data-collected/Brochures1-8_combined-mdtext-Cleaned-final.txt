Peter Lowney, Graduate of Higher Diploma in Arts in Psychology

After completing the two-year Higher Diploma in Psychology, IÂ felt I had an excellent basis for moving forward with a career in psychology, as well as being able to apply the techniques and methodologies from the course in my current career. It has also opened the door to a number of related fields in work such as HR.

The broad basis of the course gave me a good overview of the subject and of where my strengths and interests would lie for future study in psychology.

I really enjoyed the structure of the course and, although it is a significant time and effort commitment, I felt it was really worth it. The fact that it is accredited by the Psychology Society of Ireland (PSI) is a major bonus, meaning that your qualification will be recognised. I felt there was a very good balance of continuous assessment, group and project work alongside examinations, and I found the lecturers approachable and friendly.

For me, the best thing about the course was meeting fellow students from a diverse range of backgrounds and forming firm friendships."

DBS - A Short History



, Formerly known as Accountancy and Business College, DBS was established in 1975 to provide evening programmes for students preparing for the examinations of the professional accountancy bodies. The School quickly established an excellent reputation for quality and standards and its students achieved a high level of success in the professional examinations. Based on this reputation, the School developed rapidly and by the mid-1980s was providing professional accounting, marketing and banking programmes for both full and part-time students.
, In 1989 the School introduced its first undergraduate degree programme under a franchise arrangement with Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU). The academic relationship between the two institutions has developed and strengthened over the years. DBS became an Accredited Institution of LJMU in 1995 and now offers a range of programmes leading to honours degree and postgraduate awards. DBS complies fully with LJMU quality assurance procedures and conducts periodic programmatic reviews in line with LJMU policies and requirements. An academic representative from LJMU is a member of the DBS Academic Board.

DBS, QQI and the National Framework of Qualifications

As an institution designated under the relevant Higher Education Acts, Dublin Business School is accredited to offer courses leading to Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI) (formally HETAC) awards at Certificate, Ordinary degree, Honours degree and Postgraduate levels. The National Framework of Qualifications relates all education and training awards made in Ireland to each other and establishes clearly defined standards about the quality of awards and what a student should be expected to achieve for each award. The Framework also allows Irish qualifications to be compared more easily and accurately with those of other countries. This is particularly important in a European context where there have been significant moves towards greater compatibility and comparability of qualifications.

The National Framework of Qualifications comprises ten levels, with each level based on specified standards of knowledge, skill and competence. Awards at Levels 6 to 10 are made by QQI and the Irish Universities. At undergraduate level, DBS offers courses leading to QQI awards at Level 6 (Higher Certificate), Level 7 (Ordinary Bachelor Degree) and Level 8 (Honours Bachelor Degree). We at DBS see the introduction of the National Framework as an important step towards assuring students as to the quality and comparability of our awards. To quote the National Qualifications Authority, 'The introduction of the Framework, which sets the overall standards of many awards, together with the measures taken by the awarding bodies and (course) providers to build and monitor the quality of awards, will further enhance and guarantee the overall quality of awards made in Ireland.'

The following diagram illustrates the current National Framework of Qualifications in Ireland.

Recognition and Accreditation



Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI)

Quality and Qualifications Ireland was established in 2012 under the Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) Act 2012. The new Authority was created by an amalgamation of four bodies that have both awarding and quality assurance responsibilities: the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC), the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) and the Irish Universities Quality Board (IUQB). The new Authority assumed all the functions of the four legacy bodies while also has responsibility for new or newly-statutory responsibilities in particular areas.



Professional Accountancy Bodies ACCA and CIMA

All of our degrees are recognised for exemption purposes by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (ICAI), the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA), the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA) and the Institute of Certified Public Accountants (CPA). Our BA (Hons) Accounting and Finance degree programme receives the maximum number of exemptions available from the professional accounting bodies.





CIMA is the world's largest professional body of management accountants offering the most relevant accounting qualification for a career in business. It teaches the skills and knowledge needed to work across all areas of the business, not just the accounts team.



Library Association of Ireland

The objectives of the LAI include the promotion and development of high standards of librarianship and of library and information services in Ireland and to maintain the profession of librarianship in a proper status among the learned and technical professions by requiring the observance of strict rules of personal professional conduct as a condition of membership, and by ensuring that a qualification in librarianship is an essential requirement for all professional posts in libraries.



Psychological Society of Ireland

The Higher Diploma in Arts in Psychology is accredited by the Psychological Society of Ireland (PSI), the
 professional body for psychology in Ireland. As such, it seeks to promote the science and profession of psychology in 
Ireland and beyond. PSI membership now stands at over 2,000 members, and includes practitioners, educators and 
researchers, professionals and postgraduate students, as well as undergraduate subscribers. Its divisions and Special 
Interest Groups represent key areas from across the broad spectrum of psychology.



APPI

The MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy meets the Professional Body's Masters' component requirement which, when combined with the Post-Masters' component, 
makes graduates eligible to apply with confidence for accredited membership of this Body. For instance, the MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, combined with the Post-Masters' Specific Modality Training in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in The School of Psychotherapy (TSOP) at St Vincent's University, is recognised as a (minimum) 4-year training by the Association for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy in Ireland (APPI). Graduates of the combined programme, Masters + Post-Masters, are eligible to apply for membership of APPI which then automatically means membership of the Irish Council for Psychotherapy (ICP). In turn, these graduates meet requirements to apply for membership of the European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP).



IACP

IACP is a professional body which aims to maintain professional standards of excellence in counselling and psychotherapy. Membership of the organisation is open to those who meet the standards laid out by this body and whose practice work is in accordance the code of ethics of the organisation.

The MA in Addiction Studies is a rigorous and formal exploration of addictions from a variety of academic and scientific perspectives: sociological, cultural, psychological, anthropological, and psychoanalytic.

The aim is to educate students so that they can carry out research in the field of addiction and thereby critically inform policy making, as well as management of addiction services. The programme also provides clinicians with a strong theoretical foundation from where to approach the treatment of addictions.

This programme is designed for students with a background in Psychology, Psychoanalysis, Anthropology, Sociology, Social Science or a humanities discipline, who wish to acquire a postgraduate qualification in the area of Addiction. It is also very suitable for applicants with a clinical training in health or social care who wish to apply knowledge of the theory and approaches to addiction to their clinical work. In addition, the course provides an exciting and thought-provoking foundation for students who may wish to subsequently pursue training in the counselling or psychotherapy of addiction.

Structure

The full-time day programme is one year in duration and contains three twelve week semesters. The course has four key components:

, An academic programme of lectures
, A weekly seminar with emphasis on research
, Clinical visits to addiction treatment centres
, A period of research for an extended thesis

The academic component and weekly integrative seminar provide a firm foundation in core addiction issues while the clinical visits provide students with direct experience of the nature of the problems posed by addiction. The concluding period of research provides students with the opportunity to collate their study and develop a thesis question in the field of

addiction studies. The taught courses cover semesters 1 and 2 (October to May), and the clinical visits straddle semesters 2 and 3 (February to August). Independent research is pursued during semester 3 (May to August). There is also the availability of a January intake.

For part-time students, delivery of the programme is structured over two years and contains five twelve-week semesters and will require daytime attendance.

Overview

The interpretation of dreams announced psychoanalysis to the world in 1900. In it Freud proposed that 'the most complicated achievements of thought are possible without the assistance of consciousness'. This psychoanalytic position revolutionised our understanding of mental life and the basis of any psychological intervention. Psychoanalysis is a clinical practice which attends to the hidden, or unconscious, processes of the mind. Its epoch-marking insights shed invaluable light on the fragility of meaning in our lives and on the dynamics of mental health and its collapse in illness. Psychoanalysis stands at the origin of all the major developments in psychotherapy over the past 100 years. It is designed to introduce students in a thorough and rigorous way to clinical settings and practice and so is a solid basis for work in the field of mental health as well as being a foundation for training in the field of psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

Structure

, A training centred on a series of three organised placements (some clinical), each one for one day a week for 15 weeks, starting in the second semester of first year, in mental health, education and social care settings and supervised by senior mental health professionals in each placement.
, Infant observation experience supervised by a highly qualified tutor in the field

, A final year of supervised, appointment based clinical practice in settings recommended by the college. Students engage an individual supervisor for this work the fee for which is independent of the DBS programme fee.
, Weekly Psychiatric Case Conference at St. Vincent's University Hospital followed by a clinical seminar
, Weekly psychoanalytic group supervision tutorial in groups of four students
, An academic programme of lectures presented by psychoanalytic practitioners and psychoanalysts
, It's also required that students take up their own personal psychoanalysis. Cost associated with personal psychoanalysis is independent of the DBS programme fee.

Placements

Supervised placements are organised in years 1 and 2. These start in the second semester of year 1 and each placement comprises 15 weeks, one day a week, totalling 45 weeks over years 1 and 2. In year 3, students arrange their own appointment-based one-to-one sessions with clients within a placement setting. There is a requirement to complete a minimum of 50 client sessions during 3rd year. Over the 14 years the MA has been running, placements have been arranged in the following settings:

, Have the minimum requirement in English Language which is greater or equal to B2+ in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages for admission where full-time study has been conducted in a language other than English or applicants whose first language is not English
, Complete a personal statement of approximately 400 words outlining why they wish to pursue this particular course
, Attend two one-to-one interviews with psychoanalytic practitioners, one of whom is typically the Programme Leader.

Applicants with an undergraduate degree in other areas may be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Garda Vetting

The National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Acts 20122016 make it mandatory for people working unsupervised with children or vulnerable adults to be vetted by the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na National Vetting Bureau. Under the Acts, anyone whose work or activity involves unsupervised access to children or vulnerable adults must be vetted. Workers include staff, volunteers and those on student placements working for a relevant organisation where they have access to children and/ or vulnerable adults. DBS will charge a fee of â¬25 to each student for the administration and costs of obtaining Garda clearance. This fee is payable at the commencement of the programme and is non refundable.

Accreditation

The MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy meets the Professional Body's Masters' component requirement which, when combined with the Post-Masters' component, makes graduates eligible to apply with confidence for accredited membership of this Body. For instance, the MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, combined with the Post-Masters' Specific Modality Training in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy in The School of Psychotherapy (TSOP) at St Vincent's University, is recognised as a (minimum) 4-year training by the Association for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy in Ireland (APPI). Graduates of the combined programme, Masters + Post-Masters, are eligible to apply for membership of APPI which then automatically means membership of the Irish Council for Psychotherapy (ICP).

In turn, these graduates meet requirements to apply for membership of the European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP).

Career Opportunities

For students who wish to pursue training as a psychoanalytic psychotherapist, when combined with the post-Masters' training, but who have minimal clinical exposure to the phenomena of mental suffering, which includes psychiatric illness, addiction, learning disability etc., this MA provides the ideal initial step of that training. Currently a basic requirement for entry into work in the field of mental health is having experience of mental health settings during training.

The MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy is unique in Ireland in providing a very impressive amount of hours in challenging clinical educational and social care settings. A graduate with this amount of experience will have a very impressive CV if applying to work in similar settings. In addition the MA, when combined with the postMasters' training, provides a basis for developing private practice. For the duration of the MA students engage in their own personal psychoanalysis, the cornerstone of any practice calling itself psychoanalytic.

Over the years, the MA in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy has provided a very stimulating basis not only for those graduates who wish to pursue work and practice in the field of psychoanalytic psychotherapy but also for graduates who wish to work in social and community care, or educational settings.

Overview

The MA in Psychotherapy offers a postgraduate qualification which meets requirements for professional training for individuals interested in training as humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapists in the integrative model. The course has been designed for graduates from a Level 8 Counselling and Psychotherapy programme who are suitable for supervised clinical training in humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapy in accordance with the integrative model. A combination of the Higher Diploma in Arts in Counselling and Psychotherapy (or equivalent) and the MA in Psychotherapy at Dublin Business School fulfils the requirements and is recognised by the professional body of IAHIP. The MA course is also research focused and therefore provides students with a range of research skills appropriate to the field of counselling and psychotherapy.

Structure

The MA in Psychotherapy is delivered on a modular basis during evenings and weekends and will normally take students two years to complete. During each year, students will normally study two evenings a week for two 12 week semesters and attend weekend experiential workshops and seminars. In this time students will participate in experiential group learning and attend academic lectures, both of which direct their study and understanding of counselling and the theories and practices of counselling and psychotherapy.

In the second year of the programme there are two Master Class modules involving highly experienced practitioners bringing that experience to a teaching context. In order to best equip students research methodologies

and the range of contemporary issues that face professional psychotherapists will also be amongst the topics studied.

Fundamental to training in the field of counselling and psychotherapy is the undergoing of one's own psychotherapy. This work of clarifying one's actions and motivations is challenging, stimulating and ultimately rewarding at a personal level as well as grounding professional practice. Students should expect to be in their own personal therapy for the duration of the MA.

The MA programme involves students beginning supervised clinical counselling/psychotherapy practice. Supporting this, in addition to the personal psychotherapy mentioned above are two forms of clinical supervision - individual and group. The two supervision arrangements provide the opportunity for students to articulate their questions regarding their therapeutic interventions and position. Group supervision is incorporated into the MA timetable. Payment in relation to one's personal psychotherapy and individual supervision is not included in the course fee and is arrange individually with the therapist and supervisor.

Assessment

Each year students are assessed not only on their skills and academic knowledge but they also participate in two feedback meetings per year to discuss their progress in training. Feedback and assessment are the basis of a decision regarding their suitability for professional practice as counsellors and psychotherapists, and ultimately their qualification with the MA.

Demand for new aircraft continues to rise, with 17 ,000 aircraft estimated to be ordered globally over the next decade. This demand is being driven by passenger numbers that are predicted to double by 2030 to 73 million. An increasing critical factor in growth of the aviation industry are the aircraft lessors who now owe over 40% of the world's fleet (versus 25% in 2000). Of the world's top aircraft lessors, a remarkable 14 are based in Ireland. It is estimated that an Irish leased aircraft takes off every two seconds somewhere in the world.

Whilst this dominant market share is underpinned by the business and tax environments, it is also highly dependent on talent. As an industry focused educational institution, DBS sees itself as supporting the talent pillar of the Irish economy, and therefore Aviation Finance is a natural domain for the institution to explore the development of a new programme.

The Skills Strategy 2025 emphasises the 'increasingly interdisciplinary nature of the world of work [â¦] which overlaps in the skills required across different sectors and occupations'. Moreover, the Skills Strategy 2025 looks to transversal skills, basic, generic, core or practical skills as being the cornerstone for an individual's personal development and the building blocks for the development of the hard, vocational or technical skills.

The Higher Diploma in Science in Aviation Finance, is underpinned by a strong foundation in leadership and emphasises the development of effective financial management skills to structure aviation leases, structured finance deals using Special Purpose Vehicles, managing aviation leases throughout the lease lifecycle, and being well positioned to contribute to the digital transformation of aviation leasing. The long-term career prospectus for those undertaking postgraduate studies in business, commerce or economics remain excellent with increasing numbers of undergraduates going onto further postgraduate studies.

Course Content

The modules on The Higher Diploma in Science in Aviation Finance include:

, Aircraft Leasing Legal Frameworks
, Aircraft Leasing Taxation
, Aviation Finance and Financial Statement Analysis
, Aircraft Economics and Life Cycle Management
, Aviation Financial Management
, Digitisation and Innovation in the Aviation Industry

Aims and Objectives

The Higher Diploma in Science in Aviation Finance aims to provide learners with the relevant knowledge, skills and competence to engage in professional work in the aircraft leasing and securitisation industry. It will also provide learners with the knowledge, skills and competence to operate in many areas of the finance or aviation industries.

This programme covers a wide range of Aviation Finance topics, whilst providing a focus on application and the regulation required in this area. The programme focuses on practical, applied skills in core areas such as data and financial analytics, aviation finance, regulations, operations, Aviation Leasing - Tax and Insurance. Its aim is to create a competence of core financial technologies and financial operations while also enhancing the practical technical skills of the learners.

Aviation Finance can incorporate many different areas and is an evolving area. Through the work of the Programme Team and in conjunction with the industry experts, Aviation Finance has been defined as a combination of financial systems, data management and technology including areas such as

Project Management, Risk Management, Cyber Security, Law and Regulation, Information Technology, Aircraft Economics and Life Cycle Management and Aviation finance. The programme aims and learning outcomes have been designed to reflect these specific areas.

The programme incorporates a strong focus on so-called practical skills within modules to enhance learners' employability, and to equip them to integrate seamlessly into an organisation by developing skills such as leadership, self-management and teamwork that are essential in the Aviation Finance sector, which is a rapidly changing industry which requires motivated and flexible employees. The Applied Project module requires students to identify a problem or issue in the Aviation Finance domain and to apply problem-solving skills to research and analyse the issue and develop real-world solutions, and to critically reflect on this research process.

Guest Lectures from industry and the Aviation Finance sector will be invited to participate in each module. Approximately 2 to 3 hours will be devoted to domain experts in each module, where appropriate industry visits will be organised.

Additionally, students will be invited to DBS Finance Society and its FinTech Society. Students will also be invited to attend the DBS 'Fintech Breakfast Briefings', which occur regularly on campus, and various other FinTech meetups hosted in DBS e.g. FinTech Ireland Bridge with FinTech Atlanta.

The specific programme aims are to:

, Provide learners with a holistic overview of the frameworks governing aircraft leasing.
, Provide learners with an understanding of the aviation leasing taxation legislation and networks.

'Making the decision to take time out of my career and return to college to complete the full-time MBA was one to which I applied a great deal of thought, assessing the costs and benefits of taking a year out of work to enhance my academic qualifications. It was a difficult decision and one from which I have benefitted hugely. I chose to complete the MBA in Project Management in order to gain valuable knowledge and understanding that I will be able to apply at work in order to progress my career. Being able to apply my previous experience to the scenarios and discussions in the lectures, allowed me to learn and reflect on previous situations at work. From a personal point of view, the lectures on research skills and personal development offered me a valuable opportunity to reflect on my skills, development and career path and I made some friends and a network of contacts with whom I will remain in touch both personally and professionally. Since completing the MBA I have returned to work in a contract Project Management role, where I have already been able to use the skills and experience gained in the MBA. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at DBS and would recommend the MBA course.'

Overview

The Master of Science in Supply Chain Management programme (90 ECTS, Level 9) has been designed with the specific intention of responding to an increasingly global, specialised, digital and technology-enabled business environment - one that requires an efficient and effective end to end deliverables.

This programme aims to accommodate a wide audience of learners from a broad spectrum of industries whose specific learning requirements lie in the area of supply chain management (either business, or technically focused). The DBS Master of Science in Supply Chain Management programme aims to produce individuals with the specialised skills and attributes necessary to meet the demands of the modern-day supply chain management environment. Learners will understand the core principles of supply chain management, as well as procurement and inventory management at leadership level; they will be equipped with operations management and analytics expertise; possess an integrated understanding of global logistics; critically evaluate sustainable supply chains and inform business decision making in an ethical context. They will acquire the knowledge, theory and skills of

Aims and Objectives

The specific programme objectives are as follows:

1. Imbue a critical analysis of the current and emerging theories of supply chain management, informed by up-to-date research and activity in the supply chain management field.
2.  Accrue a critical, strategic, and global perspective (incorporating multiple viewpoints) for the supply chain management field.
3.  Develop practical skills in procurement and inventory management in supply chain logistics and operations including problem-identification and solving.
4.  Develop an in-depth appreciation of supply chain analytics in the form of modern data-driven metrics to business operations and how these can be generated and used.
5.  Develop in learners the competencies to be a successful leader in the supply chain environment.
6.  Create critical awareness of sustainability and ethical processes that are directly complementary and relevant to the contemporary workplace and future of work.
7. 7 .  Identify and develop autonomous learning skills for the graduates of tomorrow who can work both independently and collaboratively.
8.  Provide the learner with a comprehensive platform for career development, innovation, and further study.

Structure

Stage one of full time provides the learner with both extensive knowledge and critical understanding of the supply chain management infrastructure and landscape. The skills developed help lay the foundations and context for the advanced skills developed later in the programme. Core level skills and practical application of supply chain theories, tools and technologies are instilled through the Stage 1 modules, which include Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management, Procurement &amp; Inventory in Supply Chain Management, a chosen elective from the MBA, and Research Methods 1.

Stage two of full time builds on this by covering advanced modules allowing the learner to progress on the strategic supply chain learning curve, through Strategic and Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Operations and Analytics in Supply Chain Management, a further elective from the MBA stream, and Research Methods 2.

The students will then complete an elective capstone (30 ECTS) of either an Applied Research Project, Dissertation or Placement. Depending on the elective option chosen, this will include a robust piece of industry research underpinned by academic theory, primary and secondary data collection and applied in a coherent and industry-focused research report and artefact or traditional dissertation. The Applied Research Project, Dissertation or Placement will bring together and synthesise learning from other modules, combining research and technical skills to investigate, design, produce and critically evaluate an area of research interest.

This programme is offered as a part-time delivery with a recommended learning path that allows completion within a minimum two-year period. It is similar to the full-time programme, and is divided into four stages rather than three. In stage one of the part-time delivery, students will follow similar aims to the full-time programme. They will complete the modules Global Supply Chain and Logistics Management, Procurement and Inventory in Supply Chain Management and Research methods 1. In stage two of the programme, students will study Strategic and Sustainable Supply Chain Management, Strategic Information Systems, and Research Methods 2. Stage three of the parttime delivery has just two modules: Operations and Analytics in Supply Chain Management and Innovation and Disruptive Technologies. Finally in stage four of the programme students will complete either their Dissertation, Applied Research Project or Placement.

Teaching and Assessment

The programme will be structured in a blended format consisting of synchronous online and on-demand delivery.

The blended online delivery allows for the most appropriate mode of delivery to be applied to different parts of the syllabus. Typically, the more theoretical content would be delivered through the on-demand mode, with the discursive aspects of the syllabus more inclined to be delivered in the synchronous online mode. Although, such discursive topics can also be considered in an in-class setting. The more practical and assessment-driven parts of the syllabus can also be reserved for the in-class time. Instruction on using the tools and technologies for data analytics can be delivered in class. Formative assessment exercises can be set in any mode to allow the learners to assess progress. Peer review of these formative assessments can help drive this development, which can take place through asynchronous discussion boards or in-class or online discussions. The blended approach will also avail of directed e-learning objects, such as annotated case studies, videos and reading.

Entry Requirements

This programme is aimed at learners with a Level 8 honours bachelor's primary undergraduate degree, or Higher Diploma, in a cognate area (e.g. computer science, IT, science, mathematics, statistics, finance, economics, business (including quantitative methods), engineering, maths and management information systems), who wish to specialise in the field of supply chain management with a view to entering the industry, or those with a Level 8 honours bachelor's primary undergraduate degree, or Higher Diploma, in a non-cognate area plus three to five years' experience of logistics or supply chain management and who require a qualification in this area in order to progress professionally. These will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Learners will need to have achieved a minimum second class second division award (2.2 classification) in their honours Bachelor's Level 8 degree.

Medical Information

What do I do if I get sick when I am in Ireland?

If you get sick while you're in Ireland, here are some steps you can take to ensure you receive the appropriate care and assistance:

Assess Your Condition: Determine the severity of your illness. If it's a minor ailment that you can manage with over-the-counter medication, you might not need immediate medical attention. However, if your condition is serious or worsening, seek medical help promptly.

Contact a Doctor or GP: If you need medical attention, you can call a local doctor (General Practitioner or GP) to schedule an appointment. They can provide advice, diagnose your condition, and recommend appropriate treatment.

Which Doctor or GP should I visit?

DBS has partnered with Dame Street Medical, as our chosen student medical centre should students require a doctor's appointment. As many students may require a GP whilst studying, we believe this partnership will be beneficial to students due to its close proximity to the DBS campus.

Dame Street Medical is now taking on new patients and registering is extremely easy. To register simply book an appointment to see one of their doctors.

To book an appointment:

Call (01 6790754) or email damestreetmedicalcentre@gmail.com

What other medical options do I have outside of a GP?

Visit a Pharmacy: For minor illnesses or common ailments, you can visit a pharmacy (chemist) for advice and over-the-counter medications. Pharmacists in Ireland can provide guidance on non-prescription remedies.

Hospital or Emergency Care: In case of a medical emergency or if your condition is severe, go to the nearest hospital emergency department. Dial 112 or 999 for emergency services in Ireland.

Travel Insurance: If you have travel insurance, contact your insurance provider to understand the coverage and procedures for seeking medical care. They can guide you on how to proceed and what documentation you might need.

Public Health Clinics: Depending on the nature of your illness, you might be able to visit a public health clinic or urgent care center for non-emergencies.

Language Barrier: If English is not your first language and you're having trouble communicating your symptoms, consider having a local friend or someone who speaks English accompany you to the medical facility.

Prescription Medication: If a doctor prescribes medication, you can have it filled at a pharmacy. Keep in mind that some medications that are available over the counter in other countries might require a prescription in Ireland.



Student FAQ Guide Dublin Business School Live Document



Rest and Hydration: Regardless of the severity of your illness, make sure to rest, stay hydrated, and follow any medical advice you receive.

Stay Informed : Keep up to date with local health advisories, especially if there are any specific health concerns or outbreaks in the area.

Remember that it's important to seek appropriate medical care when needed. If you're unsure about the best course of action, don't hesitate to ask locals or staff at your accommodation for guidance. It's also recommended to have a basic understanding of your travel insurance coverage before you travel to ensure you know what to do in case of illness.

- Active Learning
- Moderation
- Creating On-Demand content (to be released)
- Copyright and teaching content (to be released)
- Programme approach to Assessment (to be released)

National Forum Short Courses

DBS will facilitate two National Forum Short Courses this summer.

These courses, which are aligned with the National Forum's Professional Development Framework, last six weeks and require approximately 25 hours of participant effort, which includes attendance at weekly seminars and the assessment. Those who complete a short course and assessment are rewarded with a National Forum Digital Badge, which is recognised throughout the Irish HE sector.

These courses have a limited number of places on them. There will be an information session on June 15th about the courses, which will run parallel from the last week in June to the end of July.

A wide screen TV, with a Neat Bar (a grey bar underneath the TV, which contains a microphone, speakers and tracking camera), has been installed in seven classrooms in DBS.

A tablet to operate the camera and speakers has also been installed in the rooms to complete the hardware side of zoom rooms.





CLASSROOM ENHANCEMENTS: ZOOM ROOMS

The online learners who are logging in via zoom are displayed on the Widescreen TV in front of the lecturer.

The microphone in the Neat Bar picks up all the sound in the room, whether the sound is coming from the front or back of the room, or whether or not the person speaking has their back to the microphone.

The tracking camera follows the movement of the lecturer. In large classrooms, The TV screen and Neat Bar are installed about a third of the way down the classroom, which means the lecturer can move around the top third of the room while still being tracked by the camera.

In smaller rooms and labs, the TV screen is at the back of the room, so online learners have a clear view of the class and the lecturer is free to move around and stay in shot. A full guide to using zoom rooms will be published shortly.

We have live tested zoom rooms with two lecturers and their classes and a currently live testing it with four more lecturers, after which zoom rooms will be rolled out to any lecturers timetabled to use zoom room classrooms.

For more information on zoom rooms, please contact isabel.ashburner@dbs.ie

DBS has the capacity to equip 17 classrooms between Aungier Street and Castle House, all of which should be fully operational by September.

Fifth Floor in Castle House classrooms

We are currently working with Facilities and Academic Operations to investigate alternative furniture arrangements for the new classrooms on the fifth floor in Castle House. Some of the options under consideration include Nodes (also known as the Dalek option), stackable flip chairs and tables and Clusters around a Screen.

Foreword

The purpose of this College Handbook is to provide you with a guide to Dublin Business School (DBS).  It  will  help  you  find  your  way  around  College  as  well  as  provide  you  with  valuable information on the resources, regulations, policies and procedures in DBS.

The  DBS  student  website  is  the  official  source  for  all  information  and  can  be  viewed  at https://students.dbs.ie/. In particular, the DBS Quality Assurance Handbook (QAH) is located here (https://students.dbs.ie/academicoperations/qah) and is the primary source of information on all College policies, rules and regulations. This College Handbook is not intended as a substitute for these sources, or other DBS official documents, and may be subject to change. So please ensure to consult the website, as well as read your DBS email, for all up-to-date information.

We recognise that this year holds many significant challenges for learners due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  DBS  is  actively  monitoring  the  COVID-19  situation  carefully  and  will  continue  to provide guidance in line with the Irish Government. 1  Information on how DBS is managing the current situation, including our plans for social distancing, teaching and the year ahead can be found here: https://students.dbs.ie/academicoperations/information-for-20-21-academic-year. Please note that arrangements are subject to change in light to the current situation.

We hope that you will have an exciting, rewarding and fulfilling experience at DBS and wish you every success on your learning journey.

1  You can view the latest information on how Ireland is responding to cases of COVID-19 on the Government of Ireland website at: https://www.gov.ie/en/campaigns/c36c85-covid-19-coronavirus/.



SECTION 1 Learner Charter

The Learner Charter aims to make learners aware of what you can expect of DBS and outlines what DBS can expect of you.

1.1 Why a Learner Charter?

DBS has around 9,000 active learners enrolled on programmes. We want the learner experience for all our learners to be a positive one. We recognise that our learners are part of a community of learning, and that we have obligations to fulfil towards our learners, and that learners likewise have responsibilities,  to  themselves,  to  their  fellow  learners  and  to  the  College.  The  Learner Charter therefore aims to set out what we see as the key areas that help to foster a supportive, constructive  and  positive  learning  environment.  This  Charter,  however,  like  the Quality Assurance Handbook (QAH) , is a 'living document' we want to respond to issues as they arise. So if there is something you think is missing, we are happy to hear about it. Your suggestions can be made in writing here.

1.2 The DBS Learner Charter

You can expect to:

1. Be provided with a welcoming and supportive environment in which to pursue your studies.
2. Be provided with a teaching and learning experience that helps you to achieve the intended programme learning outcomes, and ultimately your qualification.
3. Be given timely feedback on your academic performance on an ongoing basis.
4. Be provided with suitable resources to support your learning, and to be made aware of how to access these resources.
5. Be provided with accurate and timely information central to your studies such as timetables, forms, policies and procedures.
6. Be treated with respect, dignity and professionalism by DBS staff at all times.
7. Be provided with opportunities to take part in wider academic, professional and social activities aimed at enhancing your personal development.
8. Be provided with opportunities to give formal feedback to DBS on the quality of all aspects of the learner experience.
9. Receive prompt and timely responses to queries, complaints or other issues.



DBS expects Learners to:

1. Take responsibility for your studies and proactively manage your own learning experience.
2. Attend classes, lectures and other academic activities related to your programme of study and actively engage with/ in the content/ activity.
3. Take responsibility for the completion of all assessments, including the submission of assignments in accordance with deadlines, and similarly take responsibility for your attendance at examinations.
4. Work with staff and fellow learners to foster a positive and supportive learning environment for everyone.
5. Respect the academic integrity of the College and comply with policy and procedure as set out in the Quality Assurance Handbook .
6. Proactively ensure you are aware of key programme information such as deadlines, and to regularly monitor your College e-mail to ensure you are aware of DBS communications.
7. Use College facilities in an appropriate manner and with respect for other users.
8. Behave in a courteous and professional manner towards staff and other learners at all times.
9. Proactively inform the College if you have circumstances that you feel may impact on your studies, and to take responsibility for seeking any support that you may require.
10. Ensure that you follow all health and safety requirements of the College so as to protect yourself and the DBS community.



SECTION 2 Finding Your Way Around DBS

2.1 People you may encounter

The following DBS staff roles all play a part in the administration of your discipline area and the programmes it offers.

Programme Coordinator

Programme Coordinators provide administrative support and ensure that you are provided with full details of your programme of study. They are the first point of contact for a range of issues such as programme queries, deferrals or personal mitigating circumstances (PMCs) that may affect your learning. Programme Coordinators are responsible for day-to-day management of student information and data.

Module Leaders

Each module on your programme has a module leader. This is the main lecturer responsible for the module. They prepare and deliver the material and set and mark your assessments. They also ensure that the module content is regularly reviewed and up to date. Contact details for each module leader can be found on the Moodle page for each module.

Academic Director

Academic  Directors  are  responsible  for  the  academic  quality,  overall  management  and development  of  the  programme,  the  coordination  of  the  organisation  and  delivery  of  the programme,  and  the  support  of  learners  on  the  programme.  The  Academic  Director  has  an important role in mentoring learners and providing them with guidance and support on both academic and non-academic matters related to learner life.

Assessment and Regulations Manager

The Assessment and Regulations Manager has responsibility for assessment and examinations, academic regulations, student discipline and conduct in relation to assessment, academic records and liaison with accrediting bodies.

The Exams Team

The  Exams  Team  works  with  the  Assessment  and  Regulations  Manager  in  managing  and administering all aspects of exams, including timetabling, organising rooms, booking invigilators, receipt  and  checking  of  exam  papers  and  associated  documentation,  running  exam  events, management of scripts and provision of all information to External Examiners.



Registrar

The Registrar is the member of senior management responsible for safeguarding and promoting the academic integrity and quality, and academic standards of DBS and ensuring that DBS is operating  in  accordance  with  academic  regulations.  The  Registrar  formulates  the  academic policies, standards, processes and procedures of DBS and ensures that they are followed and enforced.

School Administrative Officer

The  School Administrative Officer manages  student  registration and  graduation events throughout the year. They are also secretary to a number of boards, including Academic Board and Board of Studies. Any learner complaints should be submitted to the School Administrative Officer  (email:  schooladminofficer@dbs.ie)  using  the Complaints  Form on  the  DBS  student website at https://students.dbs.ie/academicoperations/qah.

2.2 Timetables

Timetables, including details of the location of classes, can be found at https://students.dbs.ie/timetables ('My timetable'). Notes regarding changes will be found here and communication will be sent out to you via email. Where an unavoidable change occurs at short notice, notifications will also be sent out to mobile phone numbers. This means it is very important to keep your contact details up to date. Should you need to change these please see the Change Personal Details section of the DBS student portal.

You can obtain a personalised timetable by using the calendar in your student email account. Your timetable can also be sync'd with your mobile device.

See https://students.dbs.ie/computer-services if you require help with any technical issues.

2.3 Attendance

Students are expected to attend all of their classes, and attendance for face-to-face classes is monitored through the process of 'tagging in' electronically using your student card. If you do not tag in to your lecture you will be marked as absent.

Evidence  suggests  that  learners  with  attendance  of  at  least  80 -85%  tend  to  achieve  better outcomes on their programme. Further, poor attendance can affect the class dynamic and impact other learners, so it is in everyone's interests to maintain a good attendance record.

If you have forgotten your student card to tag in with, then you should make your lecturer aware during  or  directly  after  your  class.  The  Programme  Coordinator  cannot  update  your  record



without written confirmation from the lecturer. If you have valid reasons to miss class, a Medical Certificate or other relevant supporting documentation should be provided to the Programme Coordinator to note an 'authorised absences' on your record.

In order to help you keep track of your student attendance, the percentage is available to view on your Moodle page. Full details of the attendance policy are available in the QAH Part B Section 4: Programme Participation .

International Student Attendance Requirements

All  International  Students  who  have  a  Stamp  2  Student  Visa  have  a  minimum  attendance requirement of 85% to comply with their visa requirements.  To assist international students in this regard, we monitor and report the attendance of these students to INIS on a regular basis. We also report any students where attendance is consistently below 85%.

If you cannot attend because of illness, a certificate from a doctor will be required where the absence is greater than two days.

2.4 Class Representative System

Each class group in DBS appoints one or two Class Representatives. These Class Representatives then liaise with learners and faculty and coordinate student feedback and student input to the course review process.

At the beginning of the academic year, Class Representatives will attend training. This training will be coordinated and run by Student Services. Class Representatives will have two meetings with the Academic Director and two meetings with Student Services during the academic year and reports of these meetings will be part of DBS's formal review process.

Each Class Representative who is active during the year will be entitled to a letter of recognition to acknowledge their participation in the role.

2.5 Learner Feedback

DBS takes learner feedback very seriously and acts on a formal and informal basis to address our learners' comments and observations.  Questionnaires are  completed by  learners  on  Moodle regularly during the year to provide the opportunity for each individual to contribute directly to the  course  review  process.    Immediate  issues  are  addressed  as  soon  as  possible  and recommendations are reviewed for following academic years.



2.6 Policy on Recording by Learners

It is DBS policy that no student may record sound or video in a teaching situation, which includes lecturers, seminars, tutorials or labs, without prior written consent of the lecturer and the other participating students. Only in cases, where there are personal mitigating circumstances for a student, will requests of this nature be considered. A formal request must be made prior to any recording, and academic staff have the right to refuse where other mechanisms to support the student can be instituted. Full details of the recoding policy are available in the Learner Code of Conduct and Digital Well-Being Policies in the QAH.

2.7 Policy on DBS Recording

All live learning activities in DBS, with some exceptions, are recorded, in accordance  with the Recording of Learning Activities Policy. Recordings of learning activities are then deleted from Moodle within 12 months after the module has finished for that cohort, in accordance with DBS's Data Retention Policy (see the DBS QAH) for further information on both policies.  Learners will be notified if a learning activity on their programme will not be recorded.

Recordings  of  live  online,  hybrid  and  in-class  sessions  are  made  available  to  learners  on  the Module page on Moodle.  Recordings of learning activities are  intended to  complement live learning sessions and not to replace them.

DBS  Full-Time International Programmes FEES FOR ACADEMIC YEAR 2024/2025 (NON-EU RESIDENTS)

This leaflet gives details of tuition fees for full-time courses at Dublin Business School (DBS) for International (Non-EU) students (i.e. students who are nationals of countries outside the European Union or European Economic Area).

PAYMENT OF FEES

NOTES

Tuition fees are payable in Euro. The tuition fee must be paid as per the terms of the letter of offer. Students must pay the first year full tuition fee prior to course commencement (this is required in order for the student to be granted a visa or an extension of permission to reside in Ireland). Dublin Business School must receive the full amount as shown on the invoices for fees, rents and all other expenses. Any bank charges must therefore be paid by the person making the payment - the Remitter.

The management and administration of applications from international students applying via an agent is undertaken by DBS Services (a DBS subsidiary company). If you are an international student applying via an agent, by proceeding with an application to DBS, you agree that DBS Services will retain a fee for administration services relating to course application forms and/or visa applications carried out for you by student recruitment agents on behalf of DBS Services. This fee is only applicable in the event your application is successful and will be retained from your total fees payable. Further details are set out in our Terms &amp; Conditions found at www.dbs.ie/terms-and-conditions .

PAYMENT METHODS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS COMING THROUGH AGENTS

Dublin Business School accepts payments through a variety of payment methods, including bank transfers, credit/debit cards, e-wallets and more, through Dublin Business School's Payment Portal, powered by our official payment partner, Flywire. This portal allows you to save on bank fees and exchange rates, track your payment online from start to finish, make payments in over 140 currencies, and have access to 24/7 multilingual customer support. For students who are coming through an agency, fees must be paid through Flywire.

SCHOLARSHIPS AND DISCOUNTS

Dublin Business School offers a range of scholarships and discounts. Please contact international@dbs.ie for further information.

Please note only one scholarship or discount scheme is applicable per annum per student.

- Course fees are quoted for the academic year 2024/2025 only. Course fees for subsequent academic years may be subject to price increases.
- Students who fail examinations and have to repeat are required to pay tuition fees.
- For students that repeat exams and/or dissertations, the fees can be found via the following link: students.dbs.ie/exams-office/ repeat-assignments

Tuition fees are non-refundable. However:

- For International Students resident overseas fees will only be refunded if the visa application has been refused as outlined in the DBS Terms and Conditions section 5.7 on www.dbs.ie
- For International Students already resident in Ireland, fees will not be refunded under any circumstances after commencement of the course. Where a visa is required to be renewed during the DBS programme of study it is the responsibility of the student to check with the relevant authorities that the renewal application will be approved.
- Course commencement and start dates are subject to student numbers.
- All students for whom English is not a first language will be required to sit an English language test prior to commencement of their course. Students whose level of English does not meet the required standard will be redirected to an English language programme appropriate to their English language standard. Tuition fees for this additional English language tuition will be charged to the student. Upon successful completion of exams students may be allowed to commence their original first choice programme, subject to availability.

Dublin Business School reserves the right to alter or withdraw any modules, programmes, courses or details described on its website, brochures or other printed material. While every effort has been made to ensure that all information is correct, the College is not liable for any errors or omissions.

All programmes are run subject to demand.

Learner Conduct, Appeals and Complaints

As per the Core Statutory Quality Assurance Guidelines , it is important that the learning environment provided:

- Respects and attends to the diversity of learners and their needs, enabling flexible learning pathways

[...]

- Encourages a sense of autonomy in the learner, while encouraging adequate guidance and support for the learner
- Promotes mutual respect within the learner-teacher relationship
- Has procedures for dealing with learner complaints
- Has procedures for dealing with learner appeals

QQI (2016) 1

This section of the Quality Assurance Handbook lays out firstly the expectations for and of our learners, as well as the policies and procedures for dealing with issues such as complaints and appeals.

This includes:

- The Learner Charter and Code of Conduct -what you can expect of DBS, and what DBS expects of you as a learner
- Academic Impropriety (AI) Policy
- The Disciplinary Policy
- Appeals -what to do if you wish to appeal an academic outcome such as the grade of an assessment
- Complaints -what to do if you have an issue relating to facilities, supports provided, programme delivery, a (fellow) learner on a study programme or a member of staff.
- Cameras On Policy -for online learning.

3.1 The DBS Learner Charter

The Learner Charter aims to make learners aware of what they can expect of DBS and outlines what DBS can expect from learners.

3.1.1 Why a Learner Charter?

DBS has around 9000 active learners enrolled on programmes. We want the learner experience for all our learners to be a positive one. We recognise that our learners are part of a community of learning, and that we have obligations to fulfil towards our learners, and that learners likewise have responsibilities, to themselves, to their fellow learners and to the College. The Learner Charter therefore aims to set out what we see as the key areas that help to foster a supportive, constructive and positive learning environment. This Charter, however, like our Quality Assurance Handbook , is a 'living document' we want to respond to issues as they arise. So if there is something you think is missing, we are happy to hear about it. Your suggestions can be made in writing to the Quality Assurance Officer via quality@dbs.ie .

3.1.2 The DBS Learner Charter

Being inspired and nurtured to realise their career ambitions, learners will:

1. Be welcomed into a supportive collaborative environment, where faculty will drive engagement to meet the challenges of learning and becoming workready graduates.
2. Be guided by trained faculty who are knowledgeable and experienced in their area, will meet their deadlines and honour their commitments, particularly with regular, informative and timely feedback.
3. Experience a forward-thinking learning environment, with current accessible content that reflects today's workplace challenges and that is innovative in its application and use of educational technology.
4. Have multiple opportunities to further their holistic development through DBS organised activities and forums in addition to learning, teaching and assessment.
5. Be supported in their career planning and progression into the workplace.
6. Be treated with respect, dignity and professionalism by DBS staff at all times in a safe environment where diversity is embraced.
7. Be listened to and heard and become genuine partners in decisions that affect the student body.
8. Be communicated with promptly and accurately, using an appropriate medium, with regard to information central to their studies, such as timetables, forms, policies and procedures.
9. Be made aware of, and have supported access to, suitable resources and technologies to further their learning.
10. Be made aware of the importance of academic integrity and be guided and supported in following the rules and regulations for academic integrity as outlined in the DBS Quality Assurance Handbook.

Being proactive and participatory, learners will:

1. Attend classes, lectures and other academic activities related to your programme of study and actively engage with/in the content/activity.
2. Take responsibility for learning and proactively manage the learning experience, including attending class, submitting assessments in accordance with deadlines and engaging with learners and lecturers.
3. Be open to the challenges of learning in a forward-thinking learning environment that reflects today's workplace.
4. Embrace and develop opportunities for further holistic development outside the academic curriculum.
5. Actively engage with career planning and workplace progression initiatives.
6. Behave in a courteous and professional manner towards other learners and staff at all times.
7. Help drive and participate in activities that allow learners to become partners in decisions that impact the learning experience and the student body.
8. Proactively ensure awareness of, and action when appropriate, key module, programme and college information such as deadlines, and to regularly monitor your College communications.
9. Use College facilities and technologies in an appropriate manner and with respect for other users.
10. Respect and comply with the rules of academic integrity as set out in the DBS Quality Assurance Handbook, including those that relate to plagiarism, copyright, cheating and collusion, among others.

3.2.1 Policy Overview

Each learner at DBS is required to comply with the College's Code of Conduct. The purpose of the DBS Learner Code of Conduct is to ensure that an appropriate academic environment, in which mutual respect for all College staff, learners, visitors and guests is promoted. The Code requires reasonable behaviour and consideration for others and is intended to assist learners in spending a fulfilling and rewarding time at the College. This policy sets out DBS ' s expectations regarding learner implementation of the policy.

The Code of Conduct is intended to set and maintain acceptable standards of behaviour within the College community, to encourage individuals to accept their obligations and to maintain the College's good standing. The Code applies to all learners regardless of their study location, including

3 https://www.qqi.ie/Downloads/Core%20Statutory%20Quality%20Assurance%20Guidelines.pdf

the online learning environment. In the case of learners undertaking a programme that is a collaboration between DBS and other parties, this Code shall apply except where a specific alternative is identified.

This Code is not intended to be an exhaustive document. Other regulations concerning expected norms of behaviour and communication are documented throughout the College Quality Assurance Handbook .

The enforcement of the Code is a shared responsibility. The Disciplinary Committee is called to review cases of suspected or alleged breaches of this code. It is the responsibility of each learner in DBS to adequately familiarise themselves with this policy and the other rules and regulations that may be specific to their chosen programme of study. Ignorance of the code does not constitute adequate defence, should a learner be found to be in breach of the Code.

3.2.2 Policy Statement: DBS Student Code of Conduct

1. Commitment to the Code of Conduct

- In registering for a programme of study at DBS all learners are accepting the Code of Conduct and agreeing to adhere to the requirements and expectations identified within it.

2. General Behaviour

- All learners are expected to conduct themselves in an appropriate and respectful manner in their interactions with, and on behalf of, DBS. Learners must not engage in any activity that may negatively impact upon the name of the College, its staff or its learners.
- Learners are expected to conduct themselves legally, ethically and responsibly in all interactions and communications, including interactions through technology and social media, within and outside their programme of study.
- All communications and interactions with the College or any of its stakeholders, and on behalf of the College as a DBS learner, are expected to be conducted in a respectful manner based upon dignity, equality and inclusion.
- Any act or omission that affects adversely the rights of any other member of the College community, including partners or external stakeholders, or that disrupts the conduct of any College activity, will be considered a breach of the Code of Conduct, and may be subject to disciplinary proceedings.

3. Satisfaction of College and Programme Requirements and Regulations

- Learners take personal responsibility for their studies and their progression through their chosen programme of study and for the consequences and implications of their actions and inactions in this regard.
- Learners are required to attend scheduled classes punctually.
- o Note that this means, as a rule, prompt arrival for the beginning of class, on or before the hour. Late arrival is extremely disruptive to other students and the lecturer. Learners arriving late to on-site classes will not be able to tag in and will need to speak to their lecturers to have attendance recorded. Likewise, learners arriving late to online classes will not have their attendance counted.
- Learners must conduct themselves in an appropriate manner throughout the class. This includes:
- o Engaging with the lecturer and other learners.
- o Taking part, but not interrupting the lecturer or other learners.
- o Minimising use of electronic devices such as mobile phones except for direct interaction as directed by the lecturer as part of the class.
- Learners are responsible for the accurate and honest recording of their attendance. Any attempt to falsify attendance records is considered fraudulent and will be subject to disciplinary proceedings.
- Learners are required to maintain communication with DBS in all instances where they are unable to attend or engage with their studies. Failure to do so may impact o n a learner's enrolment status.
- It is the responsibility of each learner to familiarise themselves with the regulations, policies and procedures of DBS, including assessment regulations governing their programme, and any implications that failure to comply or adhere to specifics outlined within same may have on their enrolment status and potential entitlement to an award.
- Each learner is required to produce their Student ID Card upon request by any member of DBS staff.

4. In-Class Conduct

- Learners are required to adhere to the reasonable and lawful instruction of DBS staff during class and whilst on DBS premises.

- Where any learner disrupts a class or acts in a manner that fails to display dignity and respect to others, including by failing to follow the instructions of DBS staff, the staff member is within their rights to ask the learner to withdraw from the particular class activity and to report the learner for a breach of this code.
- No learner may record sound or video in a teaching situation (such as, but not limited to, lectures, seminars, tutorials or labs) without the prior written consent of the lecturer and the other participating learners. Only in cases where there are personal mitigating circumstances (PMCs) will requests of this nature be considered. These requests must be made prior to any recording, and academic staff members have the right to refuse where other mechanisms to support the learner can be accommodated.

5. Use of Social Media and Technology

- DBS encourages learners to engage in groups and societies and establish informal networks, including through the use of social media and technology, to promote the development and enhancement of the learner community. Participation, whilst often informal and social in nature, must be appropriate, inoffensive and respectful at all times. Learners are required to be mindful of their language and the material they choose to share.
- Content owned by, or including personal information of, other people, including text, audio, photos or video, should never be shared without their consent.
- Refer to Part B Section 3.2.7 for the full Online Code of Conduct.

6. Dealings with Staff

- Learners are required to be respectful in their dealings with staff at all times through all media (in-person, online, on the phone). Rude or aggressive behaviour will not be tolerated. Staff are entitled to end an interaction if a learner's behaviour is deemed to be inappropriate in tone or content. In such a circumstance, a formal note of the incident will be escalated to the relevant line manager and follow up action taken as required, which may involve disciplinary action.
- Likewise, staff are required to remain courteous and respectful in all interactions with learners.

7. Premises, Property and Staff Associated with DBS or its Programmes

- Learners are required to respect the staff, premises, property and fellow learners of DBS and any associated venue or partner, including local residents and businesses.
- Learners who undertake part of their studies in locations outside of DBS are required to familiarise themselves with any specific codes of behaviour or conduct belonging to those locations and adhere to them during their time there.

- Where the College is notified of an allegation of a breach of a Code of Conduct belonging to another location associated with the completion of a DBS programme of study or an official DBS event or activity, the learner can be subject to DBS disciplinary proceedings. Any student of DBS who engages in activity outside of the College or formal College events and which could bring the good name of the College into disrepute may also be subject to disciplinary proceedings.

3.2.3 Enforcement

For the purpose of enforcing this Code, DBS is entitled but not obliged to investigate any allegation of misconduct and, following appropriate disciplinary procedures, may impose a penalty or sanction where the allegation is upheld.

Any breach of this Code is normally considered a breach of discipline and will be considered under the Disciplinary Procedure. A range of penalties can be applied up to and including the requirement for the learner to withdraw from their programme and/or the College with no entitlement to a refund.

3.2.4 Rights of DBS

DBS reserves the right for any member of staff to request and to retain the student card of any individual learner, where a conduct breach is alleged.

DBS reserves the right to suspend a learner from their programme of studies and suspend their access to any DBS facilities and resources pending an investigation into any allegation of a breach of the Code of Conduct.

Where it is deemed appropriate in order to guarantee the continued smooth running of an affected programme of study, the College reserves the right to request that a learner agree to an independent assessment by a relevant professional, for example, where the health, safety or wellbeing of others is deemed to be at risk.  A failure to comply with this request may result in the learner not being permitted to continue with their programme of study.

The College reserves the right to refuse to provide a reference for the purpose of professional registration, employment or further study for any learner who has breached the Code of Conduct.

The provisions of this Code are without prejudice to the legal rights of learners. However, where DBS deems it appropriate or necessary, DBS reserves the right to notify the Gardai of any allegation of a crime having been committed or other such threat of a crime.

3.3.1 Policy Overview

Academic Integrity is defined as ' the commitment to, and demonstration of, honest and moral behaviour in an academic setting ' (The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Writing Center), and involves ' compliance with ethical and professional principles, standards, practices and consistent systems of values, that serves as guidance for making decisions and taking actions in education, research and scholarship ' (ENAI). The College is committed to the principles of academic integrity, and engages with the National Academic Integrity Network (NAIN) in strategies to support academic integrity and reduce academic impropriety.). This applies to all learners, faculty and staff of the College. Academic Impropriety is the breaching of the principles and regulations around Academic Integrity.

5 https://www.qqi.ie/Downloads/Core%20Statutory%20Quality%20Assurance%20Guidelines.pdf

DBS aim to promote academic integrity through supporting learners in developing academic writing and research skills. All learners are informed of the expectations of DBS in relation to academic work submitted for assessment and are provided with access to services to support the development of appropriate academic writing and research skills.

This policy details the formal mechanisms that DBS utilises when managing suspected cases of Academic Impropriety.

3.3.2 Policy Statement

' Academic Impropriety' includes cheating, plagiarism, forgery, collusion or any attempt, whether successful or otherwise, to gain an unfair advantage in the examination or assessment process.

Learners are advised that DBS takes cases of Academic Impropriety very seriously and will apply penalties up to and including expulsion from the College with no right to return nor to a monetary refund. This policy applies to all programmes offered by DBS. The College reserves the right to review any grade or assessment where evidence emerges requiring investigation for impropriety, up to and including grades ratified by an Examination Board or where an award has been conferred. Retroactive action may be ta ken where evidence relating to an individual learner's conduct is brought to light or where an officially sanctioned audit identifies anomalies or concerns across a cohort or cohorts. In severe cases, this may lead to removal of an award from a learner or learners.

However, malicious or speculative reports will not be entertained by the College.

DBS reserves the right to protect its reputation as an academic institution and will defend any legal challenge to its implementation of this policy and the outcomes of deliberations relating to Academic Impropriety.

Internal Examiners should be aware that poor academic conduct or academic impoverishment is not to be confused with impropriety. Instances of academic impoverishment should be addressed through marking accordingly and providing the appropriate feedback to assist academic development. Cases of suspected Academic Impropriety, i.e. the intention to secure an unfair advantage through dishonest academic practice in the assessment process, should be addressed through the Academic Impropriety procedure. A number of examples of Academic Impropriety are detailed below, and in the accompanying appendix (Appendix B.3.3.2).

DBS encourages communities of learning, the creation of learning partnerships, and authorised collaboration in assessment. However, all assessment tasks are to be entirely the work of the individual submitting it unless stated otherwise. Any assessments found to contain work the same as, or similar to, that of another learner, past or present, will be considered to be the product of

cheating or collusion, and therefore of Academic Impropriety, and penalties for Academic Impropriety will be applied as appropriate.

DBS believes there is no justification for impropriety and claims of stress, financial pressure, ill health or other such instances will not be accepted as justification for Academic Impropriety. Equally, lack of knowledge is not considered a suitable defence. Any learner who believes they are subject to pressure that is impacting their studies and their ability to satisfy assessment requirements is advised to consult Student Services, the Academic Director or module lecturer and request appropriate supports or information on the options available to them.

In order to deter learners from considering Academic Impropriety as a low-risk option in cases where they consider their failure to be likely, the Academic Impropriety Committee, when dealing with any such case brought before it, will ensure that any penalty is more significant than having made an honest attempt at assessment and failed.

Should Academic Impropriety be suspected, the learner or learners concerned will be notified of the action(s) to be taken and the potential penalties that may be applied.

3.3.3 Examples of Academic Impropriety

Academic Impropriety is broadly defined as the intention to secure an unfair advantage through dishonest academic practice in the assessment process. Examples are given below, but this list is not exhaustive, and where any case of alleged or suspected dishonest practice to gain unfair advantage is brought to the College's attention, the procedure for Academic Impropriety will apply . A full lexicon, in alignment with the National Academic Integrity Network lexicon, is available in Appendix B.3.3.2 .

An investigation of suspected Academic Impropriety and the procedure outlined below can commence regardless of whether or not the specific occurrence of suspected Academic Impropriety is specifically included as an example in this policy.



Cheating

Examples of cheating include but are not restricted to:

- Communication with a third party or copying from any other source during an examination/assessment.
,se of a third party for the completion or partial completion of an assessment e.g. friend, family member, essay writing service, or artificial intelligence software.
- Introducing any form of written or other material into a closed book examination (including that stored electronically) other than that specified on an examination paper.
,se of a mobile phone or any unauthorised electronic device during an assessment or examination.
- Forgery, alteration or misuse of College documents, records or identity cards.
- Submission of false claims of prior qualification(s), research or experience in order to gain credit for prior learning.

Plagiarism

Plagiarism is defined as the presentation of work, written or otherwise, of any other person or source, including another learner, or institution, third party such as a friend or family member, or artificial intelligence software , as the candidate's own. Plagiarism includes but is not restricted to:

- Verbatim copying of another's work without clear identification and acknowledgement.
- P araphrasing of another's work by simply changing a few words or altering the order of presentation without clear identification and acknowledgement.

,nidentified /unacknowledged presentation of another's concept as one's own.

Self-Plagiarism

Academic Impropriety also includes self-plagiarism , where a learner uses work previously submitted for another assessment or publication, whether at a previous or the current institution, and repurposes it in another assignment. While it is legitimate to draw on and develop ideas that may be covered elsewhere, it is not acceptable to re-submit a piece of work for assessment twice, and this includes blocks of text within a piece of work (unless this is specifically provided for in the special regulations of a module).  Where previous work completed can be cited, references must be applied as appropriate.

Collusion

Collusion is defined as: the conscious collaboration, without official approval, between two or more learners in the preparation and production of work which is ultimately submitted by each in an identical or substantially similar form and/or is represented by each to be the product of his or her individual efforts. Collusion also occurs where there is co-operation between a learner and an external third party in the preparation and production of work, which is presented as the learner's own.

Purchased Assignments/Essay Mills/Ghost Writing

The use of purchased material from online 'essay mills', whether purchased by the learner or otherwise, is an intentional attempt by the learner to submit work that is not their own and will be dealt with severely.

It should be noted that Ireland has introduced a law to make the advertising and provision of cheating services illegal 6 . Learners who facilitate the access of such services to College systems or learner groups (for example, providing access to learner Whatsapp groups or sharing learner contact details with these external parties) are subject to this legislation, and are in breach of data protection legislation and may be subject to the appropriate legal action.

Misattributed or Deliberately Misleading Referencing

The exercise of inserting apparently valid reference details in-text and in bibliographies, where the content referenced either does not exist, or does not relate to the matter being supported or bear

6 Qualifications and Quality Assurance (Education and Training) (Amendment) Act 2019: http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/32/section/15/enacted/en/html#sec15

any relation  to  the  argument or  evidence  being claimed.  This  is  considered  a deliberate  intent  to mislead examiners and subvert the academic review process.

Deliberate Manipulation of Submissions to Avoid Detection by Text-Matching Software

The manipulation of text to evade detection by text-matching software, such as re-wording sentences from a source, employing translation software to change the source material to another language and back  into  English,  or  inserting  disguised  characters  (such  as  characters  coloured  to  match  the background) or special characters, such that text-matching software is hindered in completing an accurate analysis.

The Unauthorised Submission of College Material to External File Sharing Sites

The  provision  of  College  material,  such  as  Assessment  Briefs,  lecture  material,  or  completed assessments,  to  an  external  file  sharing  site  (for  example,  CourseHero  or  StudyDrive).  This  action breaches both academic integrity principles, and the intellectual property rights of the College and staff.

The following practices may be considered as constituting Academic Impropriety if excessive and repeated  instances  are  identified.  Initial  instances  may  be  considered  as  the  result  of  poor  or inadequate  academic  development  or  as  academic  impoverishment,  and  should  be  addressed through learner supports, such as the Library's support classes.

Excessive-Quoting

It is important that any body of work comprises significant analysis by the learner. Therefore, it is not appropriate for an essay to consist of large numbers of referenced quotations from other sources without suitable discussion and analysis.

Excessive Paraphrasing/Re-wording

It is not sufficient to merely reword/paraphrase content. Ideas and concepts must be reframed, and insights provided. Deliberate plagiarism, including changing words to disguise a source, is a serious offence. Re-wording in this way generally results in disjointed or inelegant prose which is easily identified by markers.

3.3.4 Support Available to Avoid Academic Impoverishment or Impropriety

The College commits to supporting learners to avoid poor academic practice or misconduct, and believes that prevention and deterrence are more beneficial approaches to simple penalisation where misconduct is identified.

Learners are encouraged to engage with the support services and functions available across the College to avoid accidentally breaching academic integrity principles or requirements. These services include:

- Classes and resources hosted by the Library on information literacy and referencing;
- Sessions hosted by the Student Engagement and Success Unit (SESU) on academic writing skills;
- Resources made available to learners through Induction, on the website, and through scheduled classes with lecturers to identify academic integrity principles and practices.

A tool in effect by the College is a text-matching software, Ouriginal (formerly Urkund).

It is important for both learners and lecturers to note that text comparison software such as Ouriginal (Urkund) is only an indicative tool. Properly referenced quotations and bibliographies will be identified by the software, and the software may not identify all sources/resources. Therefore, there is no absolute percentage of similarity that is 'acceptable'. A high percentage of matching text is obviously a flag that Academic Impropriety may have occurred, but a single paragraph that is completely plagiarised is as unacceptable as a larger piece of writing. Percentages may be lower than ordinarily expected where quotations and references are included in a submission, and unusually low percentage matches should be investigated as closely as higher percentag es. It is the learner's responsibility to ensure assessments are their own work, and lecturers' responsibility to assess this:

- Learners and lecturers should not rely on the Ouriginal (Urkund) similarity percentage to assess 'acceptability' of an assignment.
- Examiners/lecturers may not submit cases of suspected Academic Impropriety based on Ouriginal (Urkund) percentage alone where this has not been properly interrogated.

3.3.5 Initial Action in Instances of Suspected Academic Impropriety

Suspected cases of cheating, collusion and plagiarism will be notified to the Examinations Team, the Exams Manager and QA Officer.

In cases where insufficient evidence is presented the case will not be progressed at that time. Where sufficient evidence is presented that Academic Impropriety may have taken place, the QA Officer or their nominee will convene the Academic Impropriety Committee.

Where the Exams Manager and QA Officer deem that on the balance of probability that Academic Impoverishment has occurred rather than Academic Impropriety, the learner will be referred to the DBS Library Service to complete a class on academic writing. However, a formal record will be kept of the case should another incident occur.

3.3.6 Whistleblowing Suspicions of Academic Impropriety

A report of a suspicion of academic impropriety that does not derive from the examination or invigilation processes, for example from another current or previous learner, is deemed to be a case of whistleblowing. This policy is not intended to be used where there are more appropriate policies and procedures available (refer to the Complaints and Disciplinary Policies).

Investigations of a report of a suspicion of academic impropriety cannot be undertaken where the report is made anonymously. Reports can be made with a request for confidentiality where there is a concern for the possibility of reprisals if the whistleblow er's identity is revealed. These requests will be raised to the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations or their nominee to consider whether the report can be appropriately considered and investigated 'anonymously'.

Where reports are made that are malicious, vexatious, or motivated by personal gain, these will be liable for disciplinary action. Reports made by an essay-writing service will be escalated to the appropriate authorities to pursue the relevant legislative action against these illegal services.

Reports should be made formally in writing, with any available supporting evidence, to dbsacademicintegrity@dbs.ie . Within data protection regulations, individuals submitting a report will not be advised of the outcome of any investigation or any detail regarding another learner or graduate's personal or academic record.

Where suspicions are brought to the College's attention outside of the examination or invigilation processes, the due diligence checks may include any of the following:

- Comparing grade profiles to identify discrepancies;
- Comparing samples of previously submitted work against the submissions in review;
- Reviewing submission files for irregularities;
- Additional checks as appropriate to the assessment(s) in review or the nature of the concern raised.

Where a report is corroborated with suitable evidence of a suspicion, the case may be escalated to the Academic Impropriety Committee or viva panel for review. Where there is no suitable evidence to corroborate a report, the case will be closed, and no for mal record left on the suspected learner's or graduate's record.

3.3.7 Suspected Academic Impropriety in Examinations

DBS reserves the right to require learners to attend a viva voce examination to verify their submission for any exam. Any learner found to be cheating in an online exam will be required to attend on campus for any future examinations.

3.3.7.1 On-site Examinations

Any member of staff who suspects Academic Impropriety during an assessment under examination conditions must report such suspicions immediately to the Lead Invigilator/Examinations Officer or representative from the Examinations Team.

Upon being alerted to a possible infringement, the Lead Invigilator/Examinations Officer is required to approach the learner concerned and issue a verbal warning to desist with any behaviours and/or hand over any items such as notes or items not permitted in the exam hall (e.g. mobile phone, dictionary, etc.).  Where necessary, the Lead Invigilator/Examinations Officer may ask the learner to step outside the examination hall. This step is confined to situations where there may be disruption to other learners or where the situation cannot be dealt with within the exam hall. Should this be necessary, a second invigilator or staff member should be present for this.

Each learner is entitled to the presumption of innocence and therefore, after the initial intervention, the learner will usually be permitted to continue with the exam, unless to do so it may cause disruption to other learners, and the examination script is submitted and marked as normal. The learner may be requested to remain in the exam venue at the end of the exam to discuss the incident with the invigilation team, and contribute to the Incident Report.

The Lead Invigilator/Examinations Officer is required to provide a written Incident Report to the Examinations Office following the exam.

The grade and feedback will not be released until such a time as the allegation has been investigated and an outcome determined.

3.3.7.2 Proctored Online Examinations

Refer also to DBS QAH Part B Section 5.10.7 Online Exams Policy

.

Where exams are deployed through a secure online proctoring environment, the recorded screen and camera of the learner and their activities may be monitored to ensure adherence to the exam conditions of the assessment.

Any member of staff who suspects Academic Impropriety during an online assessment under examination conditions must report such suspicions immediately to the Lead

Invigilator/Examinations Officer or representative from the Examinations Team. Upon being alerted to a possible infringement, the Lead Invigilator/Examinations Officer is required to contact the learner concerned and issue a verbal warning to desist with any behaviours and/or remove any nonpermitted items from the vicinity. Each learner is entitled to the presumption of innocence and therefore, after the initial intervention, the learner will usually be permitted to continue with the exam, unless to do so it may cause disruption to other learners, and the examination script is submitted and marked as normal. At the end of the examination the Quality Assurance Officer will communicate with the learner regarding the next steps in the process.

The Lead Invigilator/Examinations Officer is required to provide a written Incident Report to the Examinations Office following the exam. The learner concerned may be asked to attend a meeting online immediately following the exam in order to contribute to the Incident Report.

Where concerns arise following an exam, the proctoring report and associate recordings may be accessed to assist in investigation. Where concerns about the integrity of an exam arise, DBS reserves the right to investigate through comparison of previous work, viva voce exam, or other practice, as deemed appropriate to verify the integrity of the piece of assessment concerned.  The Quality Assurance Officer will communicate with the learner regarding the next steps in the process.

3.3.7.3 Online Moodle Examinations (non-Proctored)

Refer also to DBS QAH Part B Section 5.10.7 Online Exams Policy

.

Where exams are conducted online via Moodle but without online proctoring instituted, they are considered to be effectively openbook exams. Learners' Moodle activity is monitored and any irregularities investigated. Exam times, logins and cut-offs are strictly monitored to ensure no unfair advantage is gained by students. Where concerns about the integrity of an exam arises, DBS reserves the right to investigate through comparison of previous work, viva voce exam, or other practice, as deemed appropriate to verify the integrity of the piece of assessment concerned.  The Quality Assurance Officer will communicate with the learner regarding the next steps in the process.

3.3.8 Suspected Academic Impropriety in Grading of Learner Assessments

Any examiner/ assessor who suspects Academic Impropriety must report such suspicions to the Exams Manager or Quality Assurance Officer. In making such a report the examiner is required to provide:

- A copy of the learner submission.
- The mark sheet and feedback for the learner based on marking as normal.

- Copies of all relevant evidence/documentation supporting the suspicion, to include any source material and the Ouriginal (Urkund) report (where applicable).
- A completed copy of the DBS Academic Impropriety Form, giving reasons for the suspicion. The link to the Academic Impropriety form can be located in the Additional Documents section of this policy.

This information should be provided as soon as the suspected Academic Impropriety is identified, to allow for appropriate investigatory action and possible disciplinary proceedings in advance of the examinations and/or Examination Boards.

Each learner is entitled to the presumption of innocence and therefore the assessment is marked as normal. The grade and feedback will not be released until such time as the allegation has been investigated and an outcome determined on the balance of probability.

Where suspicion arises due to a report from text comparison software (such as Ouriginal/ Urkund), the lecturer must first have reviewed and interpreted the report and made an informed judgement on whether or not it appears Academic Impropriety may have occurred .

It is important for both learners and lecturers to note that text comparison software such as Ouriginal (Urkund) is only an indicative tool. Properly referenced quotations and bibliographies will be identified by the software, and the software may not identify all sources/resources. Therefore, there is no absolute percentage of similarity that is 'acceptable'. A high percentage is obviously of concern, but a single paragraph that is completely plagiarised is as unacceptable as a larger piece of writing. It is the learner's responsibility to ens ure assessments are their own work, and lecturers ' responsibility to assess this:

- Learners should not rely on the Ouriginal (Urkund) similarity percentage to assess 'acceptability' of an assignment.
- Examiners/lecturers may not submit cases of suspected Academic Impropriety based on Ouriginal (Urkund) percentage alone where this has not been properly interrogated.

A learner or learners must be made aware of any suspicion and of any proceedings where a matter is being investigated. Notification should be in writing from the QA Officer, normally via e-mail. The learner will be notified of their rights and provided with a link to, or a copy of, the policy and procedure along with any source material identified in cases of suspected plagiarism.

Each learner has a right to submit a statement of defence (a 'Written Submission'), or make a request to attend the formal deliberating committee in respect of a case brought against them.

Learners attending a meeting are permitted to bring a friend or relative who is not a legal representative to the meeting to support them. Should a learner choose not to submit a defence or participate in the process, the Committee is authorised to proceed.

Learners are advised that the deliberating committee is required to determine if, on the balance of probability, impropriety occurred or not.

Where suspicion arises through the academic judgement and experience of the lecturer in reviewing the learner's submission, the lecturer may request that a viva voce be held in place of a sitting of the Academic Impropriety Committee. The form of this viva will depend upon the nature of the assessment, such that a technical demonstration may be held for Computing assessments.

3.3.9 Cases referred for a viva voce

DBS reserves the right to carry out a viva voce examination for any summative assessment. A viva voce is an opportunity the learner to orally defend their submitted assessment. DBS may institute a viva voce examination in the case where clarification is required regarding some element or elements of the written piece of work. The scope of a viva examination can include:

- Confirming to the satisfaction of the panel that the submission is the learner's own original work.
- Verifying the authenticity of the research.
- Establishing that the learner is aware of the wider research field related to their dissertation topic.
- Demonstrating detailed understanding of the content of the written submission.

The panel has the authority to confirm a pass or fail mark, or a finding that Academic Impropriety has occurred, based upon the strength of the oral defence. In cases where a large disparity between a strong written submission and a poor oral defence occurs, the panel may refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee with an accompanying report; the report will also be provided to the student in advance of the Disciplinary Committee hearing. The Disciplinary Committee will impose a penalty based on the severity of the case as detailed in the report provided by the panel. The Disciplinary Committee will not revisit the case itself, the remit of the committee is to impose a minor or major penalty and provide that outcome to the student in a timely fashion.

3.3.10  Potential Outcomes (Cases referred to the Academic Impropriety Committee)

The Academic Impropriety Committee convenes several times throughout the academic year. The purpose of the committee is to assess if Academic Impropriety has occurred in cases put before it. In cases proven to constitute Academic Impropriety, the Committee has the authority to impose an

appropriate penalty. The Committee membership comprises the QA Officer, members of academic faculty, library staff, and a learner-support representative. The quorum is four.

Penalties

The Academic Impropriety Committee has the authority to impose any or all of the following penalties:

- A mark of 0% applied alongside the requirement to repeat the assessment. The repeat will carry an automatic repeat fee of â¬250.
- The module mark capped at a maximum of 40%. If at Award Stage, the final award may be capped as a pass award.
- The learner may be obliged to attend and complete the DBS Library Service course on Academic Writing and present their confirmation of completion to the Exams Manager within 4 weeks.
- The learner may be required to sit the repeat assessment in person on the DBS campus.
- The learner may be required to sit specific future assessments, as specified by the committee, in person on the DBS campus (e.g. high stakes assessments).
- Any subsequent capstone modules (e.g. project or dissertation) to require a Viva .
- The finding of Academic Impropriety recorded on the learner's transcript.

As standard the first two penalties are applied as an absolute minimum to cases upheld.

Any instances of a second or subsequent similar offence, regardless of programme framework level, or where a first offence is deemed to have been a serious enough contravention of the Academic Impropriety Policy, the Committee has the authority to impose additional penalties up to and including:

- Suspension of the learner from the College for a Semester
- Permanent expulsion of the learner from the College

The QA Officer will notify learners of the outcome or decision within five working days of the sitting of the committee.

3.3.11  Faculty Academic Integrity

DBS Faculty and staff are required to demonstrate and be committed to the highest standards of academic integrity. The College recognises the role of faculty and College personnel in rolemodelling and demonstrating positive ethical and academic practices for learners, and therefore consider breaches of academic integrity and ethics to be violations of contractual obligations of their role.

Examples of academic misconduct or negligence in the management of assessments can include:

,nwarranted bias in making assessment decisions;
- Revealing information about examination questions to students where this is supposed to be unknown by students in advance;
- Accepting bribes to influence assessment decisions;
- Invalidating an assessment by teaching to the test;
- Failing to exercise due diligence in checking for and investigating or (when appropriate) referring breaches in academic integrity.

Examples of academic misconduct in the delivery of teaching content can include:

- Over-reliance on external sources of lecture material;
- Failure to appropriately attribute sources of lecture material;
- Circulating copyright-restricted material, such as articles, books or other media, outside of the parameters of the relevant copyright restrictions of such material;
- Contributing to essay- or assignment-writing services for an external service or other third parties;
- Enabling access to learner communities for essay-writing services;
- Deliberately withholding information regarding specific arguments or theories out of a personal bias, where the argument or theory has general acceptance in the mainstream discourse.

Breaches of academic integrity and ethical principles will be managed within the College's Faculty Management or Human Resources policies and procedures with respect to the nature of the incident.

3.3.12  Suspected Assessment Design Invalidation in Academic Integrity Reviews

In the course of investigating cases of suspected academic impropriety, the Academic Impropriety Committee may identify an assessment which may have been invalidated in its deployment, due to factors such as the misuse of generative artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies, or the compromised deployment of an assessment. The Committee may come to this conclusion where a significant portion of a cohort undertaking the assessment are brought in for review for potential academic misconduct, or where the particulars of a case might shed light on aspects of an assessment deployment that were not in alignmen t with the assessment strategy or College's assessment principles.

The mechanism by which an assessment suspected of being invalidated should be escalated is set out in QAH Section B.5.1.12.1.

Where a learner has been found to have academic impropriety before the Committee escalates an assessment of concern to the programme team, and the identification of the suitable mitigation for the assessment deployment, the academic impropriety finding rem ains on the learner's record. The outcome of the review of the assessment design and its mitigation may determine it appropriate to remove any findings of academic impropriety from those learners' records. In such cases, while the academic impropriety reco rd is removed from the learner's record, a record of the outcome will remain in the Committee's tracker, for reporting purposes and where a second impropriety finding may require consideration by the Committee.

3.3.13  Right of Appeal

DBS recognises the importance of clear complaints and appeals processes. A learner may appeal a decision or finding of the Academic Impropriety Committee or viva voce panel and/or any penalty imposed. See the DBS Appeal Policy for full details. The DBS Appeals Policy can be located in QAH Part B Section 3.5.

3.4.1 Policy Overview

The DBS Complaints policy attempts to lay out processes in order to resolve complaints or issues to the mutual satisfaction of the complainant and the individual, service or department against which the Complaint or issue is being made.

3.4.2 Policy Statement

This policy is applicable to all DBS provision and all programmes leading to QQI awards, and is based upon transparency and fairness. This policy should be referenced by all learners or staff who wish to submit a complaint.

The policy is based upon transparency and fairness. This policy outlines a series of steps required to resolve complaints or issues to the mutual satisfaction of the complainant and the individual, service or department against which the complaint is being made. DBS commits to timely, transparent and fair resolution of issues within a supportive framework.

7 https://www.qqi.ie/Downloads/Core%20Statutory%20Quality%20Assurance%20Guidelines.pdf

The DBS Complaints policy reflects the principles of natural justice and cognisant of the dignity of the persons involved. Natural justice protects against arbitrary exercise of power by ensuring equal treatment and fair play. It ensures that no decision is valid if it was influenced by any other interest or bias and where the opposing party has not been afforded a full right of response. For this reason, anonymous complaints will not be considered.

All parties are advised that in making a complaint, it is expected that they themselves have complied with the requirements of the student Code of Conduct in relation to the matter concerned. It is also expected that Complaints will not be of a vexatious nature or for the purpose of personal gain.

Most complaints are capable of being resolved on an informal basis without recourse to the formal Complaints procedure. The College accepts that there might be instances that necessitate immediate engagement of formal action in response to a complaint.

DBS is committed to ensuring that:

1. Complaints are handled in a fair, transparent, timely and sensitive manner, with due recognition of the dignity and confidentiality of the persons involved.
2. Learners will not be disadvantaged by making a complaint.
3. Complaints are handled in a cooperative manner, with every effort being made to arrive at a solution by consensus among the relevant parties.
4. Complaints that impact on the assessment process, but are not directly concerned with the process, will not interfere with a learner's normal right to appeal the result of an examination.
5. The reputation and professional integrity of DBS staff and learners will be safeguarded by ensuring that complaints are dealt with in a confidential manner and are resolved to the mutual satisfaction of all parties concerned, as far as is possible.
6. Complaints that are proved to be malicious or vexatious will result in disciplinary action being taken against the complainant and other possible sanctions may arise, including the possible referral of the matter to the Gardai.
7. The principles of natural justice are applied when dealing with complaints:
8. o All parties to a complaint have the right to be heard and represented or accompanied by a friend, family member or colleague at all meetings held in relation to the complaint.
9. o The person against which a complaint is made is entitled to a right to respond to all allegations.
10. o DBS does not engage with legal representatives as part of the complaints process.

- o Any hearings or meetings will be undertaken by an independent staff member, without bias.
- o Minutes will be taken of all formal meetings and records are maintained in accordance with the College 's policy on records retention.

This complaints policy applies to all students of DBS and in respect of any service they receive from the College with the exception of academic appeals. Academic appeals should be conducted in line with the Academic Appeals Policy. The complaints procedure is not intended as a further avenue of appeal in the event that an academic appeal is not upheld.

Complaints usually fall into the following categories:

- Issues regarding learning activities
- Issues regarding academic or support services
- Issues regarding facilities
- Difficulties with a member of staff
- Difficulties with an enrolled learner

Issues regarding assessment are covered under the Policies on Assessment in the QAH Part B Section 5 .

3.4.3 Submitting a Complaint: Timeframe and Requirements

- Any complaint should be raised within 14 days of the alleged incident, matter or concern.
- All complaints received will normally be acknowledged within 5 working days of receipt.
- The person or department against whom the complaint (formal or informal) is made will normally be notified within 5 working days that a complaint has been made.
- All parties will be notified of the steps the College are taking, whether an investigation is being undertaken or whether and when meetings are to be convened.
- Anonymous complaints will not be accepted.
- In some instances, where the basis of a Complaint against a learner can be reasonably corroborated and is of sufficient severity, the Complaint may be escalated directly to a Disciplinary.

Procedure for Informal Complaints

It is expected that all complaints should be considered informally in the first instance.  This can be directly with the learner and relevant person or department, or facilitated by the Class Representative, Student Services, Module Leader, Academic Director or relevant manager.

Where complaints are made as a group these should addressed through a Class Representative or agreed spokesperson.

In order to initiate an informal complaint, the complainant is advised to directly contact the subject of their complaint or the manager responsible for the service. This can be carried out directly with the complainant and relevant person or department, or facilitated by the Class Representative, Student Services, Module Leader, Academic Director or relevant manager.

Initial informal action can be initiated in writing but will not be considered a formal written complaint at this stage. No formal record will be retained.

In some cases, where appropriate, the Academic Director or relevant department manager may also communicate with the complainant and the subject of the complaint (if applicable) if it will assist the informal resolution of the complaint.

If the matter is not resolved satisfactorily through informal discussions, the complainant can seek to raise a formal complaint.

Procedure for Formal Complaints

Formal complaints should be lodged through the online Complaint/Feedback Form (linked HERE ), and any supporting documentation should be lodged with the School Administrative Officer directly via schooladminofficer@dbs.ie .

Once initial contact has been made the School Administrative Officer will advise of the following:

- The requirement to put the complaint in writing using the relevant form .
- The right of the subject of the complaint to receive notification of the nature of the allegations made, a copy of the complaint and the details of the complainant.
- The requirement that the complainant is in a position to stand over all allegations and provide evidence to support the complaint.
- The complainant's right to representation.
- Reassurance that there will be no detrimental impact on a learner for invoking the complaints procedure.

All complaints received should be evidence-based and factual. The complaint must detail the complainant's name and contact details, any relevant documentation, dates, locations and witnesses as appropriate. Any previous efforts to resolve the matter should also be noted.

When received, the School Administrative Officer will catalogue the complaint including details of the date received, the identity of the complainant, the nature of the complaint and the individual(s) and or department(s) against which the complaint is made.

The School Administrative Officer will forward the complaint to the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations, who will acknowledge receipt of the complaint and contact an appropriate manager to investigate the complaint, if appropriate.

Where the complaint relates to the actions or activities of the Academic Operations Department, the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations will undertake the role of investigating manager.

Where the complaint is made against the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations, the School Administrative Officer will forward the complaint to the Academic Dean or the Head of Student Experience, who will appoint an appropriate manager to investigate the complaint.

3.4.4 Investigation of a Formal Complaint

Upon submission of a formal complaint to the School Administrative Officer, and the appointment of an appropriate investigating manager, the investigating manager will, where applicable, advise the person who is the subject of the complaint and provide that person with details of the nature of the allegations.

Investigation Discussions

The investigating manager can arrange to meet with the complainant and the subject of the complaint to establish facts and seek clarification. This can take place by telephone, e-mail or faceto-face. Importantly, the investigating manager is not authorised to give a viewpoint nor a decision relating to the complaint .

Any party involved in a complaint is entitled to be accompanied by a friend, fellow student or family member who is not a legal representative or advocate. Where the complainant or subject of the complaint wishes to be accompanied, the corresponding discussion must take place face-to-face.

Where the discussion is to take place face-to-face, the investigating manager may be accompanied by a note taker so that an accurate record can be created.

Such meetings can include:

- Meeting the complainant to discuss the complaint.
- Meeting the subject of the complaint, where applicable and appropriate in the view of the investigating manager.
- Interviews of any potential witnesses.

A summary of the discussions should be documented and e-mailed to all those involved in the meeting to ensure transparency. Matters of factual inaccuracy may then be identified and corrected. Reponses should normally be received within 5 working days.

Where two or more parties disagree on the record of the meeting, the conflicting versions of events should be documented and retained.

Upon completion of the investigation into the facts, the investigating manager will compile a report summarising the actions taken as part of the investigation, including a summary of the main findings and the evidence available to inform the decision-making process.

The investigating manager, having considered all the available evidence, will determine the matter following the compilation of their investigation report, and after consulting with appropriate stakeholders. The potential outcomes are:

- The outcome of the investigation confirms there is sufficient evidence to accept the complaint, and the complaint is upheld.
- The outcome of the investigation confirms that there is insufficient evidence to accept the complaint, which is dismissed.
- The outcome of the investigation determines that there is insufficient evidence to form a definitive conclusion, due to an inconclusive element.

If the investigating manager determines that the matter is more complex or that further consideration of the issues in dispute is necessary, the investigating manager will convene a Complaints Committee within 10 working days of the compilation of their report.

3.4.5 Complaints Committee

The investigating manager may convene a Complaints Committee to review the findings of the investigation. Membership of the Complaints Committee is subject to the nature of the complaint and the parties involved, but would ordinarily comprise of the investigating manager, sitting as Chair, alongside one other departmental manager and a member of the academic lecturing staff. The School Administrative Officer acts as Secretary to the Committee.

Where necessary and appropriate, to ensure fair process and informed decision-making, alternative members of staff, student representatives or an external expert may be requested to sit on the Committee.

The investigating manager is required to present the investigation to the Complaints Committee and provide clarification on any points raised. The complainant is not required to attend a hearing of the Complaints Committee, but the complainant may be contacted by the investigating manager for further clarification where required.

The Complaints Committee will meet, including remotely if the investigating manager considers this appropriate, to discuss the findings and to arrive at a fair decision.

The Complaints Committee is required to decide a complaint based on the investigating manager's report and any additional evidence presented. The potential outcomes are:

- The outcome of the investigation confirms there is sufficient evidence to accept the complaint, and the complaint is upheld.
- The outcome of the investigation confirms that there is insufficient evidence to accept the complaint, which is dismissed.
- The outcome of the investigation determines that there is insufficient evidence to form a definitive conclusion, due to an inconclusive element.

3.4.6 Determination and Notification of a Complaint

Where a Complaints Committee is not convened, due to the nature of the complaint, the investigating manager will determine the outcome of a complaint. In reaching a decision, where the complaint is upheld, the investigating manager is required to set out the subsequent action or options to be afforded to the learner.

Where a Complaints Committee is convened by the investigating manager, the Complaints Committee should arrive at a majority decision of the Committee. Where there is an even number of votes cast for both sides the Chair will invoke the right to a final casting vote. This is in addition to the Chair's own vote as a member of the Complaints Committee.

In reaching a decision, where the complaint is upheld, the Committee is required to agree on the subsequent action or options to be afforded to the learner.

The School Administrative Officer, or the investigating manager (as appropriate), will formally respond, in writing, to both parties to inform them of the findings of the investigation, any decisions made, the reason for the decision(s) and any subsequent action(s) to be taken, where appropriate. The communication of the outcome may take more than 14 days. The College will endeavour to

complete any investigation within no more than 30 days, subject to the nature of the case in question.

A copy of all correspondence, along with the investigation report and evidence, will be lodged with the School Executive Administrator and where applicable may be forwarded to Human Resources.

Where the result of the complaint includes consequent action or recommendations, the School Administrative Officer or the investigating manager (as appropriate) shall notify the appropriate person(s) or committee(s), without undue delay.

It should be noted that there can be instances where it is not possible for a decision to be reached and the College will attempt to provide further clarity to the student issuing the complaint while also providing guidance to the subject of the complaint in an attempt to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.

Both the complainant and the subject of the complaint should each be notified of their right to appeal.

3.4.7 The Right to Appeal a Complaint Outcome (a Petition)

Any party wishing to appeal the decision of the investigating manager or a Complaints Committee can do so by submitting a Petition to the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations or the appropriate nominee. Where a nominee is appointed the complainant will be notified of this and the identity of the nominee. This is distinct from the Appeals Process outlined in the QAH Part B Section 3.5. For ACCA learners, having exhausted the internal DBS Complaints process, they can escalate the complaint to ACCA and if in disagreement with the outcome can escalate to the appropriate regulator 8 .

Any Petition should be submitted within 5 working days of the decision of the investigating manager or the finding of the Complaints Committee being communicated.

Grounds for appealing the outcome must be clearly outlined in the Petition submission.

Valid grounds for this appeal can relate only to the processes and procedures followed at the previous stages.  Disagreement with the outcome of the complaint process or a request for a

8 If an ACCA learner has exhausted both Dublin Business School's complaints process and ACCA's, they can escalate to the appropriate regulator. Details of which can be found on the ACCA website at the following link: https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/footer-toolbar/contact-us/unhappy.html

rehearing do not constitute valid grounds for a Petition. As such, the Petition does not normally involve reconsideration of the original complaint and new evidence is not normally accepted at this stage.

The Registrar and Director of Campus Operations, or appropriate nominee, will determine whether or not a Petition shall be heard. The decision will be communicated to the petitioner normally within 5 working days post the Petition deadline.

If a Petition is granted the right to proceed, the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations or nominee will appoint an appropriate hearing panel. This will be scheduled at the earliest opportunity and normally not more than 14 working days after the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations or nominee has confirmed a hearing will take place.

Any party to the Petition, including Complaints Committee members, may be invited to attend the panel meeting, depending upon the nature/ basis of the Petition, or where the hearing panel deems this to be necessary. Attending parties are entitled to be accompanied by a family member, friend or colleague who is not acting as a legal representative.

The petitioner and other parties involved in the Petition are entitled to a record of the hearing and a record of the decision reached at the hearing. Where required some information may be redacted in accordance with data protection legislation.

The outcome of the Petition will be communicated to the petitioner and other parties at the earliest opportunity.

No further right of appeal is available once the hearing panel has met and determined the outcome.

3.4.8 Reporting and Recording Complaints

A list of formal complaints managed under this process will be maintained by the School Administrative Officer.

A summary report, detailing the number of complaints, the nature and focus of the complaint, the outcome of the investigation and any corrective action recommended will be submitted to the Academic Board at the end of each academic year.

Where applicable the outcome of complaints received will also be provided for consideration by the Senior Leadership Team which is responsible for addressing areas of common concern and ensuring appropriate intervention(s) and/ or corrective actions at institution level to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.

3.5.1 Policy Overview

DBS recognises that learners are entitled to the right of appeal against a decision of a lower-level decision-making authority by making a request to a higher one. This policy aims to facilitate such requests from learners and to further provide a mechanism to have grievances and complaints investigated, to a fair and adequate conclusion.

3.5.2 Policy Statement

Any learners on programmes leading to QQI awards, and any learner on a non-accredited programme may seek an appeal. This policy should be referenced by all learners who wish to submit an appeal. All appeals and decisions must be evidence based.

11 https://www.qqi.ie/Downloads/Core%20Statutory%20Quality%20Assurance%20Guidelines.pdf

This policy should be referenced when submitting an appeal against:

- An assessment decision (as an appeal or verification of results).
- A programme or module deferral decision.
- A decision regarding a request for Personal Mitigating Circumstances to be applied for an assessment or assessments.
- A decision/finding of the Academic Impropriety Committee.
- A decision/finding of Disciplinary Committee.
- Required withdrawal of a learner from a programme of study.

This policy does not apply to appeals against Admissions or Programme Deferral Request decisions by the Admissions team during a programme application. These appeals must be directed in writing to the Chief Commercial Officer -see QAH Part B Section 1.4.7.

The Academic Appeals Policy does not apply to appeals against a finding of the Complaints Committee. Such an appeal is outlined in the Complaints Policy as 'submitting a Petition', and is detailed in Section 3.6.7 below.

This policy is founded upon the principles of transparency and fairness and recognises a learner's right to question a decision-making authority within DBS. This policy outlines a series of steps required to fulfil these processes. Learners are also advised to view the Additional Documents section of this policy for additional relevant links. DBS commits to the timely, transparent and fair resolution of issues within a supportive framework.

Overall responsibility for the academic appeals process rests with the Academic Board. The Academic Board delegates responsibility to the Exams Manager or the Quality Assurance (QA) Officer to consider grounds for an appeal, and convening an Appeals Committee made up of appropriate senior DBS personnel.

3.5.3 Submitting an Appeal: Timeframe and Requirements

Any appeal must be submitted by the specified appeal date which will have been determined previously by the initial decision-making committee. Ordinarily, the timeframes to submit an appeal would be within 10 days of the communication of the decision or release of results to a learner.

An Appeal Form must be submitted and accompanied by a detailed written submission and supporting documentation (if appropriate). A link to the Appeals Form can be found in the Current Students area of the College website, and is attached to this policy under Additional Documentation.

Appeals submitted without a detailed written submission or for which the fee has not been paid, will be rejected. It is the learner's responsibility to ensure that an Appeal Form and all accompanying documentation is lodged fully and correctly.

It is important to note that additional appeal opportunities and requests for an extension of an appeal deadline will not be granted.

3.5.3.1 Appeal Fees

Appeals against assessment results must also include evidence of payment of the relevant fee per module. Payments can be made online, by telephone or at Reception. Learners are reminded to include the payment reference number on all submitted documentation.

Learners will not be entitled to a refund if an appeal application is rejected.

Learners will be entitled to a refund of the appeal fees if an appeal results in a learner's mark being increased. The fee for that specific appeal will be refunded. Where multiple marks are appealed at any one time, only those resulting in an upgrade will be refunded.

3.5.4 Grounds for Appeal

An appeal submission must specify the grounds on which the appeal is requested, and must contain all information that the learner wishes to have taken into account. The Appeal Form, the detailed written submission and any accompanying documentation, must be submitted to the Quality Assurance Officer through the Service Desk , using the correct Appeal Form. No matter will be considered in the absence of a correctly submitted Appeal Form. In addition, the nature of the appeal must be clearly identified in the correct field on the form. Learners are further advised that a request for a rehearing is not valid grounds for an appeal.

3.5.4.1 Academic Judgement and the Assessment Process

Learners are advised that a request for a rehearing is not valid grounds for an appeal. Assessment decisions are made within the internal and external moderation processes, and a request for a regrading is not valid grounds for an appeal. Learners are advised to avail of the Verification Request process to confirm the accuracy of a grade (see the Quality Assurance Handbook Part B Section 5.9), or review feedback from an examiner to understand the basis of a grade awarded.

While the Appeal process may result in an amendment to an assessment outcome, disagreement with the academic judgement of an examiner is not valid grounds for an appeal. It is rather a recognition that extraneous or disclosed circumstances make it appropriate to change the final decision in respect of a particular learner's performance.

Disagreement with a decision is also not considered grounds for an appeal.

Appeals which question the academic judgement of examiners shall not be admissible.

The only permissible grounds for an appeal are:

- The learner believes that there was a substantive irregularity in the College's procedures or regulations and/or in the manner in which those procedures or regulations were executed by the original decision-making committee.
- The learner believes there was a substantive irregularity in the Assignment brief or the Examination Paper or in the assessment process.
- The learner believes that there were mitigating or other circumstances which the College was not aware of when its decision was taken, and valid reasons why this was not and could not be communicated to the College in advance to the decision being made.

The Quality Assurance Officer will receive all appeal applications and ensure that they have complied with submission requirements. The Assistant Registrar or the Exams Manager in conjunction with the Quality Assurance Officer will consider the appeal and the grounds on which it is sought.

Where the Assistant Registrar or the Exams Manager has chaired any of the prior proceedings connected to an appeal they cannot be involved in the appeal, and an appropriate replacement nominee will be appointed.

3.5.5 Presentation of New Evidence

Where the learner wishes to present new evidence, this must be identified and presented at the point of applying for an appeal. Beyond this point, new evidence not identified will not be considered by the Appeals Committee unless exceptional circumstances are identified, and these are accepted at the Chair's discretion.

Learners are reminded that evidence of Personal Mitigating Circumstances (PMC) is reasonably expected to have been presented in advance or at the time of the original decision. The Appeals Committee will only consider a late declaration as grounds for appeal where there are valid reasons for non-disclosure at an earlier stage and must be accompanied with:

- Evidence that confirms that the circumstances were present during the period under consideration.

and

- Evidence to show why the learner was unable to disclose at an earlier time, or valid reasons as to why this could not be disclosed earlier.

An unwillingness to disclose, a lack of appreciation/awareness of the potential impact of personal circumstances, or a lack of knowledge of the regulations are not considered as valid justifications for a failure to submit evidence at the time of the event. Nor will they justify a late submission of a PMC evidence.

For a claim of valid reasons for non-disclosure to be accepted, it is normally expected that the circumstances themselves were exceptionally serious, or had an exceptionally serious impact on the learner, and there were substantial reasons why the learner was unable or unwilling to disclose them at the time.

Medical or other professional certification must confirm that the learner attended the relevant professional appointment(s) during the period under consideration for the circumstances outlined. Post-dated certification will not normally be considered. The dates of attendance must be stated by the professional along with verification of the circumstances claimed.

3.5.6 The Handling of an Appeal Application

The QA Officer in conjunction with the Assistant Registrar or the Exams Manager will consider each application to determine whether there are grounds for appeal. Where the appeal is of a decision in which the QA Officer was involved (such as an Academic Impropriety investigation), the alternative QA Officer or suitable nominee will facilitate the review process.

An application for appeal will be rejected outright where it is considered that there are no identifiable grounds or where the appeal deadline was not adhered to. Where an appeal application is rejected outright, the QA Officer will notify the learner of this outcome and the fact that there is no further right of appeal. In such cases the process concludes at this point. Learners will not be entitled to a refund if an appeal application is rejected outright.

Where the Assistant Registrar or the Exams Manager or QA Officer believes that there are grounds for an appeal, a verification process is undertaken. The Exams Office will conduct a review of the learner's result. The review ensures that the result published by the College is free of any errors of fact.  Learners are advised that an appeal of an assessment decision may result in the confirmation, the uplift or the downgrading of the initial result/decision.

3.5.7 The Appeals Committee

Where a learner has been found to have valid grounds for appeal and the verification process identifies anomalies or discrepancies in process, an Appeals Committee is convened in order to determine the appropriate actions arising.

The Appeals Committee should aim to reach a majority decision. Where there is an even number of votes cast for both sides the Chair will invoke the right to a final casting vote. This is in addition to the Chair's vote as a member.

3.5.8 Notification of the Outcome of an Appeal

The QA Officer will notify the learner in writing of the decision of the Appeal Committee and, where applicable, any subsequent action required. Where an appeal is upheld, the Chair, through the QA Officer, will notify the relevant departments of the outcome, along with any actions arising.

Where the appeal relates to an award and certification has been requested from QQI, the Exams Manager will take responsibility for updating that request.

3.5.9 The Conclusion of the Appeals Process

A decision of the Appeals Committee of the Academic Board is final. Once the Appeals Committee has declared its decision, the Appeals process concludes.

Learners are advised that, as per QQI Assessments and Standards, Revised 2013 , QQI does not have a role to play in a learner's appeal of the provider's assessment decisions.

Where an appeal fee has been paid and the appeal outcome results in a learner's mark being increased, the fee for that specific appeal will be refunded. Where multiple marks are appealed at any one time, only those resulting in an upgrade will be refunded.

DBS is committed to ensuring that all decisions pertaining to assessment are fair and that learners have access to clear consistent and comprehensible appeals procedures.

3.5.10  Dissatisfaction with the Outcome of the Appeal Process and lodging a Complaint

If a learner is dissatisfied with the outcome of the appeals processes and believes that the procedures have been conducted improperly then she/he has a right to submit a Petition to the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations in writing to quality@dbs.ie within 5 working days of the announcement of the decision. Complaints regarding the outcome of an Appeal are distinct from the process outlined in the DBS QAH Complaints Policy in Section 3.6 .

Valid grounds for a Petition can relate only to the processes and procedures followed at the previous stages. Any Petition regarding the outcome of an Appeal is not a re-opening of the appeal, and the learner must provide reasonable evidence of procedural impropriety. Disagreement with the outcome of the Appeal process or a request for a rehearing do not constitute valid grounds for a Petition. Grounds for submitting a Petition against the Appeal outcome must be clearly outlined in the Petition submission.

Learners must ensure that the completed Petition (which should include full details of the Petition) is submitted by the published deadline. If any relevant supporting documentation is not available at this time, this should be indicated in the written submission and supplied within a maximum of 10 working days. Learners should be aware that after this time their Petition will be considered without reference to outstanding supplementary evidence.

The Registrar and Director of Campus Operations, or appropriate nominee, will determine whether or not a Petition shall be heard. The decision will be communicated to the petitioner normally within 5 working days post the Petition deadline. If a Petition is granted the right to proceed, the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations or nominee will appoint an appropriate hearing panel.

3.6.1 Policy Overview

DBS learners are responsible for their own actions, behaviours and decision-making. However, in order to ensure a respectful environment conducive to learning and development, DBS further imposes minimum standards of conduct that are expected of all learners. This is reflected in the Learner Code of Conduct, hereafter referred to as the Code. The Learner Code of Conduct is laid out in Section 3.2 above. This Disciplinary Policy sets out DBS's general approach to managing discipline and suspected breaches of the Code.

3.6.2 Policy Statement

The DBS Disciplinary policy is applicable to all learners, whether they are enrolled on an accredited or a non-accredited programme.

Learners are advised that any breach of the Code may be considered a disciplinary offence and be subject to disciplinary action as outlined in this policy. Where an allegation of misconduct is upheld, appropriate sanctions will be applied up to and including the requirement to withdraw from the

12 https://www.qqi.ie/Downloads/Core%20Statutory%20Quality%20Assurance%20Guidelines.pdf

College and the programme with no entitlement to full or partial refund. Additionally, any repeat of misconduct by an individual following disciplinary action may result in immediate suspension or expulsion, in particular with respect to major offences under the code of conduct. Where the College believes there is a risk to an individual or individuals in the College, whether students or staff, arising from the conduct of a learner, the College reserves the right to suspend studies and/or attendance on campus.

DBS reserves the right to suspend a learner pending investigation when it is in receipt of an allegation of a breach of the Code of Conduct or a formal complaint that has been escalated to disciplinary action. In all such cases, the investigation will be processed as a priority. The College is not liable for any delay in the completion of a programme of study for any learner who is suspended pending an investigation where a reasonable and justifiable decision to suspend is acted upon.

In the interest of all parties, these procedures will be invoked as soon as possible and concluded as quickly as possible. Due consideration must be given to timings of assessments and examinations and the Board of Examiners meeting.

3.6.2.1 Escalation and Representation

Where appropriate and feasible, the College will seek to resolve any breach of the Code of Conduct without the requirement to invoke formal disciplinary proceedings. In such cases, learners are required to meet with the appropriate manager or department head to discuss the concerns and, if necessary, agree on the steps required to avoid any future recurrence.

However, it is accepted that there may be instances that necessitate immediate engagement of formal disciplinary proceedings in which case the procedure set out below will apply.

The College will not normally engage with legal representatives or advocates as part of the implementation of this policy. This is an internal procedure for the purpose of managing learner conduct and does not and will not normally include dialogue with or between legal representatives of either or all parties.

However, where the College considers that matters of a criminal nature are likely to have occurred, the College can refer the matter to An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na or the law enforcement agency of the relevant jurisdiction.

3.6.2.2 Entitlement to Information

This disciplinary policy is based on a principle of natural justice which means that anonymous reports of a breach of conduct or anonymous complaints will not be considered and all parties have the right of response to any allegation.

All learners subject to a disciplinary investigation are entitled to be informed of the identity of the reporting party or complainant, except where it is felt this might present serious risk to that individual or others associated with them. The subject of the disciplinary investigation is also entitled to receive details of the allegations made against them and afforded appropriate opportunity to respond.

3.6.2.3 Communication and Record of an Investigation

Where a learner has allegedly committed an offence or breach of the Code of Conduct, they will be notified in writing (usually via e-mail) of the nature of the offence, their rights, and the procedure involved.

At any stage of these proceedings, the learner will be notified in writing (usually by e-mail) if they are required to attend a meeting. The learner will also be informed of their rights. Should a learner decide not to attend an investigatory or Disciplinary meeting at any stage, the appropriate committee or panel is authorised to proceed in their absence.

A written record will be made at each stage of this procedure. In the event of a finding that no offence has occurred, all records will be destroyed unless it is suspected that an allegation was made maliciously or in bad faith. This in turn may result in a further investigation or the opening of a new disciplinary proceeding.

3.6.3 Receipt of an Allegation of Misconduct or an Alleged Breach of the Code

An allegation of misconduct or an alleged breach of the Code must be reported to the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations or nominee (such as a member of Senior Management), who will review the allegation and determine what action is required.

Formal proceedings under the disciplinary policy will only be opened where it has not been possible to resolve the matter informally or the alleged offence is considered to be:

- A serious breach of the Code of Conduct.
- A repeat instance of a breach of discipline on the part of the learner.
- Academic Impropriety.

Note: Cases of Academic Impropriety are managed by the Quality Assurance Officer in accordance with the Academic Impropriety Policy (see above Section 3.3).

3.6.4 Investigating an Allegation under this Policy

On receipt of a report of misconduct, with the exception of Academic Impropriety, the assigned manager will review the report and any associated evidence and will determine the next steps, depending on the nature of the offence.

The learner will be notified of the allegation and invited to attend a meeting or respond in writing. In the case of an allegation or evidence of a serious offence, the learner may be temporarily suspended with immediate effect, pending a full investigation and review. Information uncovered in the course of an investigation can warrant suspension at a later stage.

Any individual invited to attend an interview as part of the investigation is entitled to be accompanied or represented by a third party who is not acting as a legal representative, such as the class representative or a family member or friend.

3.6.4.1 Failure to Respond to an Allegation

The failure to respond to an allegation will result in the case proceeding without the response. The case will not be terminated as a result of non-response from the learner concerned.

3.6.4.2 Potential Outcomes from an Investigation

Having invited a response from the learner at the centre of the allegation of misconduct, the assigned manager is required to compile a written report summarising the allegation and any supporting evidence. Upon completion of the report, the assigned manager is required to report one of the following outcomes:

- No offence
- An offence has occurred
- The matter is unresolved.

Decisions will be based on the evidence presented and determined based on the balance of probability.

1. A finding that no offence has occurred

If the assigned manager is satisfied that there is no case to answer, i.e. that no offence has occurred, the matter will be considered closed and all records will be destroyed after 14 working days, unless there is evidence to suggest that the original allegation was made maliciously and/or in bad faith.

2. A finding that an offence has occurred

- For minor offences, the assigned manager will impose an appropriate penalty.

- For serious offences, the assigned manager will refer the matter to the Disciplinary Committee for the purpose of imposing penalty or penalties.

The assigned manager must notify the learner of the intended action and the fact that a record of the offence(s) will be kept on their file.

3. A finding that the matter is unresolved

Where the matter remains unresolved, the assigned manager must convene a Disciplinary Committee to further review the evidence and make a judgement on whether an offence has occurred, and penalties associated if applicable.

The assigned manager must notify the learner of this in writing.

3.6.5 Disciplinary Hearing

A Disciplinary Committee must be convened as soon as is practically possible and minimising delay to reduce any impact on the learner, following the decision of the assignment manager being made known, or the decision of the Academic Impropriety investigation being made known.

The Disciplinary Committee membership comprises:

- Assigned Manager (Registrar and Director of Campus Operations, Exams Manager or nominee) (Chair)
- 1 x Academic staff representative
- 1 x Support staff representative
- 1 x member of Student Services

The Disciplinary Committee should only proceed with a meeting or hearing where the required quorum is present. The QA Officer or School Administrative Officer will act as secretary to the Committee.

In the case of Academic Impropriety, due to the earlier involvement of the Exams Manager, the Disciplinary Committee will be chaired by the Academic Dean, an appropriate Academic Director, or the Registrar and Director of Campus Operations (or nominee).

Any person involved in the formal complaint or with a pre-existing relationship with the learner concerned is excluded from membership of the Committee.

Once the Committee has been confirmed, the assigned manager will write to the learner and advise them of:

- The date, time and location of the hearing.
- Membership of the Committee.
- Their entitlement to be accompanied by a friend, a family member or a colleague who is not acting as a legal representative.

The Disciplinary Committee shall hear the case and record its deliberations and finding(s).

- In the case of the admission of a serious offence by the learner at the investigation stage of proceedings, the remit of the Committee is to determine the appropriate penalty.
- In the case of non-resolution at the investigation stage of proceedings, the Committee is required to determine, on the balance of probability, whether or not an offence has occurred, and the appropriate sanction to be applied if applicable.

Where the Committee determines on the balance of probability that no offence has occurred, the matter will be considered closed and all records will be destroyed, unless there is evidence to suggest that the original allegation was made maliciously and/or in bad faith.

Where the Committee determines on the balance of probability that an offence has occurred OR acts on admission of an offence in the investigatory stage, a penalty proportionate to the offence will be imposed.

The Secretary, on behalf of the Chair, will write to the learner and advise of the finding(s) of the Disciplinary Committee and what, if any, sanction is to be applied. The learner will also be advised of their right of appeal and the appeal process. The penalties that can be applied for minor and serious offences are outlined in the DBS QAH Part B Section 3.2.5-3.2.6 .

3.6.6 Right of Appeal and the DBS Appeals process

A learner may appeal a decision of the Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the DBS Appeals Policy outlined in Section 3.5 of this document.

3.6.7 Criminal Matters

DBS Policy is that any criminal matters are reported to the GardaÃ­ or the authorities of the relevant jurisdiction.

3.6.8 Malicious or Bad Faith Allegations

At any stage in the course of an investigation, where there is evidence to suggest that an allegation has been made maliciously or in bad faith, disciplinary proceedings may be initiated against the individual(s) making the malicious allegation.

Where allegations are made in good faith, the College forbids retribution or retaliation of any kind against the individual(s) making the allegation. Any retribution or retaliation would be deemed a serious offence within the Code of Conduct and result in disciplinary proceedings being initiated against those responsible.

3.7.1 Policy Overview

Learners not having their cameras turned on during class time is seen to impact negatively on faculty-learner engagement and learner-learner engagement.   Requiring learners to have their cameras when attending classes online reflects practice in the workplace, where those attending online meetings for work would be expected to have their cameras on.  This policy is in line with DBS stated strategic goal of creating work ready graduates.  Students are notified about the cameras-on policy during inductions.

It should be noted that online learning is not for every learner.  Learners unable to satisfy this policy and keep their cameras on during an online class may conclude that online learning is not an appropriate learning environment for them.

3.7.2 Policy Statement

- Learners are expected to have their cameras on when attending a class online unless they have notified their lecturer of a valid reason why their cameras are off.
- When attending a class online, learners are expected to ensure they are in a private place free of distractions, where it is acceptable to have their cameras on.
- o It is acceptable for a learner to notify a lecturer that their camera and/or microphone will be off for all or some of the duration of a class for valid reasons.

Learners can notify lecturers by either emailing them before the class. Acceptable reasons for turning off the camera include:

- Camera/microphone does not work (this will be acceptable temporarily)
- Wifi is not strong enough
- Having the camera/microphone on will disrupt the class (this will be acceptable temporarily).
- Learners may be ill.
- Having the camera on increases level of anxiety for the learner
- Reasons for keeping the camera off are temporary and the learner is expected to resolve these issues or reconsider whether online learning is for them.
- Faculty are expected to have their cameras on for the duration of a class being delivered online.
- Faculty may remove from an online class learners who do not turn on their cameras and do not provide a valid reason for not turning on their cameras in accordance with Section 3.2 Learner Code of Conduct Policy DBS QAH.

Practical Queries

What is the weather like in Ireland?

Ireland enjoys a mild, temperate climate with warm summers and mild wintersâ¦for the most part. Weather extremes are very rare here. In winter, temperatures vary from 3 to 8 C. In summer, averages range from 12 to 18 and peak in the low 20's.

The one thing you can count on in Ireland is rain. December and January are the wettest months. Snowfall in winter tends to be light and typically lasts no more than a couple days. The summer periods can be very enjoyable with long evenings and mild conditions making it very pleasant for socialising outside during the weekends.

Will I need to bring my own winter clothes?

You should definitely bring clothes for the varying elements of the Irish climate. A good rain jacket will serve you very well in most circumstances. We would recommend that you also bring good footwear with you.

But do not worry about bringing loads of heavy items with you, there are loads of fashion and outdoor wear retailers within walking distance from the DBS campus. We have a wide variety of branded DBS clothing available from the Student Services Hub, which includes jacket, hoody's, jumpers, tee's, and most important of all rain jackets.

Should I bring my own laptop or should I get one over there?

You can bring your own laptop to Ireland, as most electrical items should work over here. However you may need to use an adapter if the plug sockets don't match with yours.

If you do want to get a laptop over here, there are a lot of options for you to purchase one at an electrical appliance store.

Which plug sockets are used in Ireland?

For Ireland the associated plug type is G, which is the plug that has three rectangular pins in a triangular pattern. Ireland operates on a 230V supply voltage and 50Hz.

Medical Information

What do I do if I get sick when I am in Ireland?

If you get sick while you're in Ireland, here are some steps you can take to ensure you receive the appropriate care and assistance:

Assess Your Condition: Determine the severity of your illness. If it's a minor ailment that you can manage with over-the-counter medication, you might not need immediate medical attention. However, if your condition is serious or worsening, seek medical help promptly.

Contact a Doctor or GP: If you need medical attention, you can call a local doctor (General Practitioner or GP) to schedule an appointment. They can provide advice, diagnose your condition, and recommend appropriate treatment.

Which Doctor or GP should I visit?

DBS has partnered with Dame Street Medical should students require a doctor's appointment. As many students may require a GP whilst studying, we believe this partnership will be beneficial to students due to its close proximity to the DBS campus.

Dame Street Medical is now taking on new patients and registering is extremely easy. To register simply book an appointment to see one of their doctors.

To book an appointment:

Call (01 6790754)  or email damestreetmedicalcentre@gmail.com

What other medical options do I have outside of a GP?

Visit a Pharmacy: For minor illnesses or common ailments, you can visit a pharmacy (chemist) for advice and over-the-counter medications. Pharmacists in Ireland can provide guidance on non-prescription remedies.

Hospital or Emergency Care: In case of a medical emergency or if your condition is severe, go to the nearest hospital emergency department. Dial 999 for emergency services in Ireland or 112 for emergency services in any European Country.

Travel Insurance: If you have travel insurance, contact your insurance provider to understand the coverage and procedures for seeking medical care. They can guide you on how to proceed and what documentation you might need.

Public Health Clinics: Depending on the nature of your illness, you might be able to visit a public health clinic or urgent care center for non-emergencies.

Language Barrier: If English is not your first language and you're having trouble communicating your symptoms, consider having a local friend or someone who speaks English accompany you to the medical facility.

Prescription Medication: If a doctor prescribes medication, you can have it filled at a pharmacy. Keep in mind that some medications that are available over the counter in other countries might require a prescription in Ireland.

Rest and Hydration: Regardless of the severity of your illness, make sure to rest, stay hydrated, and follow any medical advice you receive.

Stay Informed : Keep up to date with local health advisories, especially if there are any specific health concerns or outbreaks in the area.

Remember that it's important to seek appropriate medical care when needed. If you're unsure about the best course of action, don't hesitate to ask locals or staff at your accommodation for guidance. It's also recommended to have a basic understanding of your travel insurance coverage before you travel to ensure you know what to do in case of illness.
