Besides offering resources and helping you prepare for teaching, the library also frequently runs workshops to support faculty and students.
The Library workshops aim to ensure that all DBS students will have necessary information literacy skills to succeed in their academic work, in the workplace and beyond.
The topics covered in our workshops include:
The library workshop pageprovides full details of the workshops the library offers.
Research shows that there is a positive correlation between these types of information literacy instruction and student success (ACRL,2017).
DBS Library has adapted a new Information Literacy Model to inform its information literacy practice. This model is called the Framework for Information in Higher Education developed by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL). This model reflects the needs of students in a rapidly changing information landscape where students are both creators and consumers of information. This model emphasizes the key importance of behaviors like self reflection and self direction learning in the learning environment.

The Learning Unit (LU)at DBS, staffed by Bernadette Higgins (Senior Educational Developer) and Sylwia Plucisz (Educational Developer) plays a pivotal role in supporting academic management and advancing teaching and learning. Our mission is to promote excellence, foster innovation, and enhance collaboration across all areas of education.
Our core objectives include providing Continuous Professional Development (CPD) for faculty helping them to design and implement evidence-based, pedagogically sound learning, teaching and assessment strategies.
LU primarily supports lecturing faculty but also offers resources and training to other learner support staff. We host drop-in "Ask Me Anything" (AMA) sessions for personalised advice, alongside a range of self-service resources such as video tutorials, CPD lessons, and instructional guides. We also guide new faculty members through all DBS Learning Technologies and support their journey towards earning professional badges by completing DBS Module Pathway OnDemand lessons.
LU works alongside other departments in DBS such as SESU, Exams, Academic Operations, Registrar, Library, IT, Content Production and Student Experience to ensure that faculty training is informed by all areas of the DBS Learning Ecosystem.
Beyond internal support, LU offers faculty the chance to pursue the Advance HE Fellowship in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education. We also promote external development opportunities, such as AHEAD UDL badges and other professional HE badges provided by the National Forum.
