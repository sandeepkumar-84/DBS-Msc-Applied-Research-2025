Dr. Anna Wolniak is a lecturer in Sociology and Social Science at Dublin Business School for over ten years, she has been also teaching Sociology at Dublin City University for eight years. Her PhD focused on legal consciousness and behaviour regarding copyright law on the internet, particularly on attitudes towards sharing, copying and downloading digital materials. Technology and social norms are still among her main interests, especially the intersection between law, morality and technical innovations. Over the years, she has also developed a special interest in inequality and social categorisation – how categories of difference are implicated in the production and reproduction of inequality and what can be done about it.
She has been teaching on a variety of core sociological modules regarding inequalities and sociological theory, as well as those with wider social science scope, like migration, social policy, poverty, youth and children studies. She has been a supervisor of many research projects from the area of social science.
