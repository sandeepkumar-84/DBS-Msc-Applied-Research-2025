The CAO (Central Applications Office) process is important not just to students, but to other members of the family too. Unfortunately, some parents can feel left out of this process. Additionally, they may not have experience with the online CAO system. So, here’s a guide to the CAO aimed at parents and guardians. Hopefully this will help not just with the process itself, but as a guide on what to talk about and how to discuss this process.In this post, we will be using the phrase ‘parent’, but of course, this advice is applicable to anyone who’s a carer for someone of Leaving Certificate age, whether you’re a stepparent, foster parent, carer or relative.
When talking to Leaving Cert students about college courses, look at it from as many angles as possible.
1. Favourite subjects
Talk to them about their preferred subjects and favourite parts of school. Note, this doesn’t necessarily mean the subjects they get the highest grades in!
2. Personal interests
What are their strengths and talents? What are their hobbies? And are any of them relevant to a future career? For instance, if they’re captain of a team, management might be an option. Maybe they’ve shown an entrepreneurial flair already, in which case business could be the route for them. Or they are empathetic and interested in human rights and justice, which might point to a career in the psychology, law, charity/NGO, or nonprofit sector.
3. Previous work experience
By the time the student is filling out the CAO form, they might have had work experience in TY (transition year) or in a summer or part time job. This might give them a steer in what they like, or dislike, about working life.
Find and browse a college prospectus for any college that’s under consideration. A prospectus usually contains information about the institution and the available courses, including minimum requirements for courses, student experience opportunities, and other support services available to students.
Read the prospectus for information about the different courses, modules and subjects, especially for the first year, to see if the subjects or college are a good fit. For example, are they more suited to practical assignments or academic learning? Also, are there any subjects in the course that might prove especially challenging?
Encourage the student to pick up information at school’s career fairs, and events such as Higher Options in the RDS. Also, don’t forget to register for events, such asDBS’s open events.
5. Routes to the course
Maybe most important, but a piece of advice often ignored: List courses in order of preference, not in order of point requirements. In other words, the most-preferred choice should be what’s top of the list.
It’s not just academic talent and preferences that decide on a CAO course. Other factors include:
Minimum entry requirements (for example,here are the minimum requirements for DBS)
Job market in relation to the qualification earned
Other routes: It’s worth examining whether or not there are routes to the course beyond the traditional Leaving Certificate points race. Some diploma courses can then lead to degree courses, for instance.
One aspect of CAO application that can slip through the net is deadlines. There’s no shortage of key dates, so parents and students alike should keep a calendar or diary of key dates.
For the most up-to-date important CAO dates, please visit theCAO website.
The CAO will be in regular contact with students throughout this process, so it’s helpful to be aware in advance of the important emails that will be winging their way to the applicant’s inbox. The student will receive regular correspondence throughout the application stage. Make sure to remind the student about these emails regularly, and when they arrive, to collectively and thoroughly read these emails, and especially to notify CAO immediately if you spot any errors or omissions.
Application number email
This is the first correspondence applicants will get from CAO, and a pretty important one. They should receive it immediately after applying online. The automated e-mail will have the applicant’s application number, an e-mail verification code and the application details. Remind applicants to write down their CAO application number and keep it somewhere safe and easy to find, as it will be needed for future correspondence.
Statement of Application Record
Before June (probably before the end of May) every applicant should receive a Statement of Application Record. This is a significant email, giving the applicant the chance to review their account information, and correct it if an error slipped through.
Offer Notification/Statement of Application Record
(August or earlier) - At this stage, hopefully, the prospective student will get notification of an offer, or a Statement of Application. A statement of application means they didn’t get an offer in this round.Make sure that the applicant checks that all the information the CAO has on file is correct.If they get an offer notification, this means that they are entitled to a place on one of their Level 8 or Level 7/6 courses (or possibly both).
Let’s look at this from two angles. Firstly, the emotional one. Don’t panic if they don’t get their first choice straight away. The second choice might be just as good, or you can wait until the second round of offers.
If they do accept an offer, it’s vital that they accept the offer (online) by the reply date given.
If they are in the fortunate position of having an offer from both lists, they have to choose between them.
Accepting a round one offer doesn’t stop students from getting offers in later rounds. If they accept a new offer, they must inform the HEI. The new offer automatically cancels the previous one.
The best way to contact CAO is via theCAO website. For urgent enquiries, they are also contactable at 091 509800. However, as you might expect, it can be hard to get through at busy times of the year, so online correspondence is recommended in most circumstances.

Deciding on your future can feel overwhelming, and it’s completely normal to have second thoughts about your CAO course choices. Perhaps you’ve discovered a new passion, received updated career advice, or simply want to explore different options. The good news?
The CAO Change of Mind process allows you to update your course preferences, ensuring you make the best possible decision for your future.
If you submitted your initialCAO applicationby the February 1st deadline, you can modify your choices within the designated Change of Mind period. This guide will walk you through the entire process, covering key dates, step-by-step instructions, common concerns, and expert tips to help you make informed decisions.
The CAO Change of Mind process is a facility that allows applicants to amend their course selections after their initial submission. This option is particularly beneficial if you’ve had a change in interests, achieved different grades than expected, or received new insights about your chosen career path.
To be eligible, you must have submitted an initial CAO application by February 1st. If you meet this requirement, you can adjust your choices as many times as you wish within the Change of Mind period—completely free of charge.
Understanding the key dates for the Change of Mind process is essential to ensure you don’t miss out on making adjustments. The process operates within a set timeframe each year:
Start Date:The Change of Mind facility typically opens in early May, allowing students to begin changing their course choices.
End Date:The final deadline for submitting any changes isJuly 1st at 5 PM. After this point, no further modifications can be made.
Updating your CAO choices is a straightforward process. Follow these steps to ensure your changes are recorded correctly:
Log in to your CAO account Visit theCAO websiteand enter your login details under the ‘My Application’ section.
Navigate to the Change of Mind section Once logged in, find the ‘Change of Mind’ facility, where you will be able to view your current course selections.
Update your courses You can add, remove, or reorder courses as needed. It’s important to list them in your genuine order of preference—placing your most desired course first.
Save your changes Click ‘Continue with course changes’ to confirm your updates. Ensure you review all selections before continuing.
Verify your changes After submission, you should receive an acknowledgement email from CAO. Double-check this email to confirm that all modifications have been recorded correctly.
Can I add new courses?
Yes, the CAO Change of Mind facility allows you to add new courses, remove existing ones or reorder your preferences. Explore yourCAO course options at DBS.
What if I miss the deadline?
Missing the July 1st deadline means you will not be able to make any further changes. Your most recent selections before the deadline will be the final ones considered for admission.
Will changing my mind affect my chances of getting an offer?
No, your order of preference is what matters most. CAO processes applications based on the highest course preference for which you meet the entry requirements. If you qualify for multiple courses, you will only receive an offer for the highest-listed course on your list.
If you’re thinking of making changes to your course choices, consider the following:
Evaluate your interests and strengths: Think about what subjects you enjoy and where your skills lie. Choosing a course that aligns with your interests will make your studies more fulfilling.
Research thoroughly: Look into course content, career prospects, and points requirements. Check university websites, attend open days, or speak with current students.
Seek advice: Guidance counsellors, teachers, and even current students can offer valuable insights into course suitability and career paths.
Consider practical factors: Financial implications, travel, and accommodation should also play a role in your decision-making process.
Making the right changes is important, but so is avoiding common pitfalls. Here are some mistakes to steer clear of:
Missing the deadline: Ensure you finalise changes before July 1st at 5 PM.
Forgetting to save changes: Always confirm that your changes have been saved correctly.
Not checking points requirements: Some courses have high points thresholds, so make sure you meet the entry criteria before adding them.
Following peer pressure: Choose courses based on your personal interests and goals, rather than what friends are selecting.

DBS has become the first independent higher education institution (HEI) to complete the CINNTE review process - an institution-wide review process – which assesses and reports on the effectiveness of internal quality assurance systems.
Through its CINNTE cycle of reviews, QQI assesses and reports on how effectively HEIs are maintaining and enhancing quality in education. The reviews explore how institutions have improved their teaching, learning and research systems, and how well institutions have aligned with their own mission, quality indicators and benchmarks.
Anindependent teamof national and international experts completed a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the QA system in DBS, recognising instances of good practice which deliver impact for students and staff, and making recommendations on areas for improvement.
See the review report published by QQI.
DBS was recognised for its activities in a number of areas including:
Its approach to creating a sense of community for all students and a cultureof collegiality wherein staff and students are responsive to each other and the staff in particular take pride in advancing a student-centred ethos.
Its commitment to continuous improvement and to developing a quality culture across the entire organisation through self-reflection, collaboration and inclusive approaches.
Its multi-layered approach to identifying areas for improvement at programme level which when aggregated can affect systematic change under particular themes at discipline level.
The dedication and enthusiasm of the ASC staff and the comprehensive structure of supports throughout the student journey, including library support for both students and teachers.
The comprehensive validation process in DBS that includes a wide range of stakeholders who are encouraged to engage fully in the programme development and decision-making processes thus fostering greater transparency and inclusiveness.
Speaking on the publication of the report, Professor Sander Svaeri, Rector at Oslo New University College, Norway, who chaired the DBS review team said,
“DBS did an outstanding job hosting the committee; they were well prepared and professional. When meeting representatives from each section, it was evident that quality practices and preparations for the visit were rooted throughout the entire organisation. The review team was especially impressed by DBS's ability in advancing a student-centred culture. It was obvious to us that they take pride in caring for the students' learning and well-being. We could also see a quality culture focused on paying attention to and continuously improving different aspects of quality throughout the institution.”
Responding to the publication of the report, Tim Bicknell, President of DBS said,
"DBS is delighted to see the publication of the QQI CINNTE report. The process was constructive, searching and enabled a highly valuable process of self-reflection. That process has enabled DBS to strengthen further in our absolute commitment to our students, their journey through DBS and beyond and quality in all aspects of teaching, learning and assessment. The review also reinforced the value being generated by the strong governance framework we have in place locally through our Board and internationally through our parent, Kaplan. We are in a strong place as we celebrate our 50th anniversary in 2025 and look to grow further in Ireland and abroad. The review team's observation that we are "creating a quality culture with faculty and staff who care for their students" was heartening to see. That focus sits at the heart of our culture.
I would like to thank the panel for the positive approach they took and the insights they generated through their approach. Many thanks to QQI too who have guided us constructively through this process. I would also like to thank the entire DBS team who engaged professionally and with genuine pride throughout the process.”
Finally, Dr Padraig Walsh commended DBS on its engagement with the Cinnte review process, remarking,
“QQI's CINNTE review cycle plays a crucial role in ensuring and overseeing the quality of higher education in Ireland. The publication of this report is an important milestone for the larger independent/private higher education institutions as they are now included in the cycle of institutional reviews. QQI welcomes the findings of the review team highlighting DBS’s student-centred ethos, their approach to creating a sense of community and commitment to continuous improvement of the quality culture across the organisation. Equally, the report outlines recommendations which will help DBS to further strengthen its education offerings and continue to deliver high-quality outcomes for all its students.”DBS CINNTE Quality Review Profile 2025

Athena SWAN, established by the UK Equality Challenge Unit in 2005, is an internationally recognised framework and accreditation scheme. It celebrates best practices in promoting gender equality across higher education and research institutions.
The Bronze Award is not just a recognition, it is a commitment. As part of this award, we have developed an ambitious 58 item action plan, which we will implement over the next four years to further embed gender equality across all levels of our institution. This award will be valid until November 2029.
This significant milestone reflects our deep commitment to advancing gender equality and fostering a culture of representation, progression, and success across our institution. This achievement is a testament to the unwavering dedication and hard work of our Self-Assessment Team and the broader commitment of our staff and students to creating an equitable and inclusive environment.
We are profoundly grateful for everyone’s contributions that made this possible. Together, we can build an even stronger, more inclusive community at DBS.

DBS has partnered with Hidden Disabilities Sunflower to become the first educational institution in Ireland to formally recognise the Sunflower
Demonstrating support to those with non-visible disabilities is part of the DBS’s ambition to make everyone feel comfortable and accepted here
The Sunflower is recognised in many countries around the world
Today, DBS has become the first Irish Educational Institution to officially recognise the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower.
At the launch, Tim Bicknell, President of DBS, said:
“We are proud of DBS and the diverse and inclusive culture it has built.
1 in 5 people in Ireland have a disability and 80% of these are non-visible. So, in line with the DBS value to empower and support, we have joined the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower Initiative - we want everyone to feel comfortable and accepted here.
We would like all of DBS staff across faculty and offices to be equipped to recognise a Sunflower wearer and respond accordingly, to help create a more inclusive, understanding DBS.”
Students at DBS can choose to wear a Sunflower lanyard, wristband or pin to indicate a non-visible disability. The Sunflower is a discreet way of saying 'I might need extra help, understanding, or just more time'.
DBS Faculty and Staff have been trained to understand what an invisible disability is and how best to approach and support Students wearing the Sunflower. All new staff will be trained during induction and the DBS Disability and Inclusion Officer, Hamza Razaq, along with the Well-being Officer of the DBS Students’ Union will actively promote and support the initiative amongst the Student population.
Increasing the awareness and acceptance of non-visible disabilities will provide a more inclusive learning environment for students.
DBS has almost 9,000 students, from over 80 countries, studying at Undergraduate and Postgraduate levels in 2024.
Paul White, CEO of Hidden Disabilities Sunflower, said:
“We are delighted that Dublin Business School has become a member of the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower, committing to fostering a welcoming and disability-inclusive environment for students and staff. DBS attracts students from around the world, and the beauty of the Sunflower removes the language barrier. It is a non-verbal indicator that the wearer has a non-visible disability, signalling that they may need an offer of support, empathy, understanding and kindness.”
For more information, please contact[email protected]
Since the Sunflower was established in the UK in 2016, it has been adopted globally by organisations to support their colleagues and customers. The Sunflower is recognised across a broad range of sectors - ranging from retail, financial services, transport including over 285 airports and 18 airlines, travel and tourism, education as well as healthcare, emergency service and entertainment. With a strong global presence, the Sunflower is a private multinational company headquartered in the UK that has operations in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, Latin America, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Mauritius, the UAE, the UK and the USA.
