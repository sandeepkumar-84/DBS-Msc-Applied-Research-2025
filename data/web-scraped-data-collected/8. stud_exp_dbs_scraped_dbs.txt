• Offer a variety of support from personal advice to organising sports teams
• Place an emphasis on empowering the student and facilitating their development.
• Provide an interface between staff and students
• Provide a forum for student input into academic and administrative matters
• Provide a channel for information to be passed on to students
• Finally, Student Services provides a public face for the College both to students and those outside the College
Our Student Services department looks after the academic, cultural and personal needs of our students. The department works as an important interface between college staff and our students, delivering information to students and taking feedback on academic and administrative matters.Read more...
The school takes an active interest in the welfare of each and every student at DBS. The Student Services department is available to help with many aspects of student life, from finances to accommodations, study issues and travel and work visa applications.

A great way to meet people is to get involved in one of the many clubs and societies at DBS, catering for the interests of all students. Off the sports field the college has plenty to offer through a variety of societies.Read more...

Dublin Business School is keen to ensure that all students experience equality of opportunity in reaching their educational potential and we welcome applications from students with disabilities, learning difficulties or long term illnesses.  We offer a wide range ofeducational supportswhich can be arranged by registering with the Learner Supports Service.
If you are considering applying to DBS you are very welcome to come in and have a chat with the Disabilities Support Officer prior to completing an application. We understand you may have some concerns about studying at third level and about the support you can expect to receive. We would be happy to talk through the options with you to allow you to make an informed decision about where to study.
The DBS Learner Supports Service was established with the sole objective of promoting equality of access to learners with disabilities and we welcome applications from students with disabilities. We are committed to ensuring that you can successfully pursue your chosen qualification with us and in order to support this commitment, we endeavour to provide the necessary support and facilities to students who may require it.
The Disabilities Support Officer is the primary point of contact for all applicants to the college who may require additional support throughout their time with us. Students applying directly to the college will be required to indicate on their application forms that they have a specific learning difficulty, ongoing / long term illness or disability and will then be contacted by the Admissions Office / Disabilities Support Officer who will discuss the details of the support services available in more detail.
You may also be required to complete a Disability Information Form which will be sent to you once your application has been processed. This form is used to clarify the supports you may have received to date and to ascertain if there is anything additional that we can offer you.
Applicants who are applying through the CAO are encouraged to indicate on their application forms, any disability, ongoing illness or specific learning difficulty for which they may require additional support.  Applicants should then go on to complete a Supplementary Information Form which requests additional information on the disability and/or specific learning difficulty and these details are then presented to the HEIs.
Once a Supplementary Information Form is received by the college you will be contacted by the Admissions Office to offer you the opportunity to come in to discuss the various supports available to you and to ensure that your particular requirements can be facilitated. Please note that all information will be treated in the strictest confidence.We recommend that you consult page 7 of the CAO Handbook for full details on disclosing a disability and the Supplementary Information Form if you have not already done so.
If you have declared a disability as part of your application to DBS then our admissions staff will arrange an appointment with the Disabilities Support Supports Officer for you. This will allow us to discuss your needs and any concerns with you in advance of your accepting a place on a DBS programme.If you have not declared a disability in your application then you can arrange an appointment with the Disabilities Support Officer at anytime before or after beginning your studies. We recommend that you register as early as possible as the sooner we are informed of your needs the sooner we can begin supporting you.
Appointments to meet the Disabilities Support Officer, can be made by emailing[email protected]or calling 01 4177506. The Disabilities Support Officer is based in the student services hub on the fourth floor of the DBS Castle House building.

From School to College | Your First 100 Days at DBS
The first 100 days at college are often considered a pivotal period that can significantly shape a student's overall experience and success. This initial phase (or first 12 weeks) is not just about attending classes and finding your way around campus; it’s about laying a strong foundation for your academic journey, building essential relationships, and establishing habits that will support you throughout your college years.
Throughout this period you will get a chance to meet our various support teams such as the Student Experience Team, your Students’ Union, SESU Team, Lecturers, Library staff, and our Careers Hub who all support students in developing the skills they need to succeed with their college journey.
Students can also expect tons of fun events and exciting activities which offer opportunities to socialise, interact and explore new areas of interest.
Here’s a quick guide to getting you started during your First 100 Days at DBS.
College academics can be a major leap from secondary school, with increased expectations and a more self-directed learning approach. The first 100 days are crucial for adapting to this new academic environment. During this time, students learn to manage their coursework, balance multiple assignments, and develop effective study routines. Establishing good academic habits early on, such as attending lectures regularly, participating in discussions, and seeking help when needed, can set the tone for future academic success.
College is not just about academics; it’s also a time for social growth. The first 100 days are an opportunity to build your social network, which can greatly enhance your college experience. Making friends, joining clubs, and participating in campus events can help you find your community and create a sense of belonging. These social connections often become your support system, helping you navigate the challenges of college life and providing a source of encouragement and motivation.
For many students, college is their first time living away from home, which brings a new level of independence. The first 100 days are when you start learning how to manage this independence, from handling your finances to taking care of your day-to-day needs. This period is also about learning to balance the freedom of college life with the responsibilities that come with it. Developing good time management skills, creating a routine, and learning to make healthy decisions are all critical during this time.
College offers a wealth of opportunities, and the first 100 days are the perfect time to start exploring them. Whether it’s joining a student organisation, participating in extracurricular activities, or attending career development workshops, getting involved early can enrich your college experience. This is also a time to start thinking about your future goals and taking the first steps towards them, such as exploring internships, research opportunities, or networking events.
The transition to college life can be challenging, and the first 100 days are often when students face some of their biggest adjustments. Homesickness, academic pressures, and the struggle to find a balance between work and social life can be overwhelming. However, these challenges are also opportunities for growth. Learning to navigate these difficulties early on can build resilience and equip you with the skills to handle future obstacles more effectively.
The first 100 days at college are a formative time that can influence the rest of your academic journey. By focusing on building a strong academic foundation, establishing a supportive social network, embracing your independence, and taking advantage of the opportunities available, you can set yourself up for a successful and fulfilling college experience. This period is not just about surviving the transition to college life; it’s about thriving in it and laying the groundwork for your future.

Students' Union (SU) Team
Welcome to the Dublin Business School (DBS) Students' Union!As the heart of student life on campus, the Students' Union (SU) is here to ensure that your time at DBS is not just about academics, but also about making lifelong memories, forging friendships, and finding your voice within the college community.
The Students' Union at DBS is a student-led community dedicated to representing, supporting, and advocating for all students. Whether you're a first-year student or approaching graduation, the SU is here to ensure your needs and interests are met. From organizing events to providing essential services, the SU plays a vital role in enhancing the student experience.
One of the core functions of the Students' Union is to represent the student body. The SU acts as a bridge between students and the DBS administration, ensuring that your opinions, concerns, and ideas are heard and addressed. Whether it's about academic issues, campus facilities, or student welfare, the SU is your voice within the college, advocating for changes and improvements that benefit the entire student community.
Life at DBS is vibrant and diverse, thanks in large part to the events and activities organised by the Students' Union. From social events like Fresher's Week, parties, and cultural celebrations to educational workshops and guest lectures, the SU ensures there's always something happening on campus. These events are a great way to meet new people, explore new interests, and create unforgettable experiences.
The SU is also responsible for supporting and managing a wide range of student-run clubs and societies. Whether you're interested in sports, arts, culture, or academics, there’s likely a club or society for you. And if you can’t find one that matches your interests, the SU can help you start your own! Joining a club or society is a fantastic way to engage with like-minded peers, develop new skills, and enrich your college experience.
Getting involved with the Students' Union is easy and rewarding. Whether you want to join a club, attend an event, or run for a position, the SU is always open to new members and ideas. You can start by visiting the SU Hub on campus, attending the events, or following them on social media to stay updated on what's happening.
At DBS, the Students' Union is more than just an organization; it's a community. A community that thrives on student participation, innovation, and diversity. Your experience at DBS is what you make of it, and the SU is here to help you make the most of it. Whether you're looking to make friends, develop skills, or simply enjoy your time at college, the Students' Union is your go-to resource.
