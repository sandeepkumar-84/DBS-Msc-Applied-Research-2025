# DBS-Msc-Applied-Research-2025
This repository contains the implementation of a DBS-specific chatbot developed as part of the MSc Applied Research Project (2025). The project compares Transformer (SentenceTransformers + T5 with FAISS) against traditional LSTM for text and voice-based interactions, including model development, evaluation, and user interface integration.
